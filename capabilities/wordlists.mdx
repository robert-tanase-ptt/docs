## Overview

Wordlists are collections of words, paths, usernames, or passwords used by various security testing tools. Pentest-Tools.com provides default wordlists for common use cases, and you can create your own custom wordlists for specialized testing.

<Info>
Creating and managing custom wordlists is available on **NetSec**, **WebNetSec**, and **Pentest Suite** plans. All users can view and use the default wordlists.
</Info>

## Tools that use wordlists

The following tools support custom wordlists:

| Tool | Wordlist Use |
|------|--------------|
| **URL Fuzzer** | Directory and file discovery paths |
| **Password Auditor** | Username and password lists for credential testing |
| **Subdomain Finder** | Subdomain names for DNS enumeration |

### URL Fuzzer

The URL Fuzzer uses wordlists to discover hidden directories, files, and endpoints on web servers.

- **Light scan**: Uses a smaller, focused wordlist for quick discovery
- **Deep scan**: Uses a comprehensive wordlist for thorough coverage
- **Custom**: Use your own wordlist for specific testing needs

### Password auditor

The Password Auditor uses two types of wordlists:

- **Username wordlists**: Lists of common usernames to test
- **Password wordlists**: Lists of common passwords to attempt

This allows for dictionary attacks and password spraying against various services.

### Subdomain finder

When performing DNS enumeration, the Subdomain Finder uses a wordlist of potential subdomain names to discover valid subdomains through brute-force resolution.

## Default wordlists

Pentest-Tools.com includes several default wordlists that are available to all users:

| Wordlist | Description |
|----------|-------------|
| Common usernames | Frequently used usernames for credential testing |
| Common passwords | Popular passwords for dictionary attacks |
| URL Fuzzer (Light) | Small wordlist for quick directory discovery |
| URL Fuzzer (Deep) | Comprehensive wordlist for thorough fuzzing |
| Subdomain enumeration | Common subdomain prefixes |

<Tip>
Default wordlists cannot be edited or deleted. They're maintained by Pentest-Tools.com and optimized for common testing scenarios.
</Tip>

## Creating custom wordlists

To create a custom wordlist:

1. Go to **Settings** → **Wordlists**
2. Click **Create wordlist**
3. Enter a **name** and optional **description**
4. Add your words (one per line)
5. Save the wordlist

### Wordlist limits

| Limit | Value |
|-------|-------|
| Maximum size | 16 MB |
| Maximum word length | 200 characters |

<Warning>
Some Unicode characters may take up more space than English characters. If your wordlist fails to save, try reducing its size.
</Warning>

### Best practices for custom wordlists

<AccordionGroup>
  <Accordion title="Keep wordlists focused">
    Smaller, targeted wordlists are often more effective than huge generic ones. Create specialized wordlists for specific types of targets.
  </Accordion>
  <Accordion title="Remove duplicates">
    The system automatically removes duplicate entries, but starting with a clean list improves upload performance.
  </Accordion>
  <Accordion title="Use descriptive names">
    Name wordlists clearly (e.g., "API Endpoints", "Swedish Passwords") so you can easily find them later.
  </Accordion>
  <Accordion title="Include variations">
    For password lists, include common variations like numbers, special characters, and case changes.
  </Accordion>

## Managing wordlists

### Editing wordlists

1. Go to **Settings** → **Wordlists**
2. Click on the wordlist you want to edit
3. Modify the contents, name, or description
4. Save your changes

After saving, the system reports the number of distinct, non-empty words in your wordlist.

### Deleting wordlists

1. Go to **Settings** → **Wordlists**
2. Select the wordlist(s) to delete
3. Click **Delete**

<Warning>
Deleted wordlists cannot be recovered. If a scheduled scan or robot uses a deleted wordlist, it will fall back to the default.
</Warning>

## Sharing wordlists

You can share wordlists with team members:

1. Go to **Settings** → **Sharing**
2. Find the team member you want to share with
3. Set the **Wordlists** permission level

### Permission levels

| Permission | Capabilities |
|------------|--------------|
| **No access** | Cannot see or use your wordlists |
| **View** | Can see and use your wordlists in scans |
| **Edit** | Can see, use, and modify your wordlists |

<Note>
Shared wordlists appear in the team member's wordlist dropdown when configuring scans.
</Note>

## Using wordlists in scans

When launching a scan that supports wordlists:

1. Configure your target and scan options
2. Select **Custom** scan type (or equivalent)
3. Choose your wordlist from the dropdown
4. The dropdown shows both your own wordlists and those shared with you

### Wordlists in Scheduled Scans

Scheduled scans remember your wordlist selection. If the wordlist is later deleted:
- The scheduled scan falls back to the default wordlist
- You'll be notified of the change

### Wordlists in Robots

Pentest robots can use wordlists for tools like URL Fuzzer and Password Auditor. Configure the wordlist when setting up the robot block.

## Wordlist sources

Here are some popular external sources for security testing wordlists:

- [SecLists](https://github.com/danielmiessler/SecLists) - Collection of multiple wordlist types
- [fuzzdb](https://github.com/fuzzdb-project/fuzzdb) - Attack patterns and primitives
- [PayloadsAllTheThings](https://github.com/swisskyrepo/PayloadsAllTheThings) - Useful payloads

<Warning>
When using external wordlists, ensure they comply with your testing authorization and scope.
