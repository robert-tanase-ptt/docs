## Overview

The SharePoint Scanner identifies vulnerabilities and misconfigurations in Microsoft SharePoint deployments. It tests for exposed web services, user enumeration, accessible default pages, and configuration issues.

The SharePoint Scanner is a **vulnerability scanner**: it tests SharePoint sites for security weaknesses from an anonymous user's perspective. It does not add data to your [Attack Surface](/using/attack-surface/attack-surface-overview). Identified vulnerabilities are reported as [findings](/using/findings/findings).

## Supported targets

| Target type | Examples |
|-------------|----------|
| **URL** | `https://sharepoint.example.com`, `https://example.com/sites/mysite` |

<Note>
Provide the SharePoint site URL. The scanner performs a black-box assessment from an anonymous user's perspective.
</Note>

## Tests performed

The SharePoint Scanner runs all tests in a single scan. There are no scan mode options.

| Test | Description |
|------|-------------|
| **Server Fingerprinting** | Identifies web server software, technology stack, and operating system |
| **SharePoint Fingerprinting** | Detects SharePoint version from HTTP headers |
| **SharePoint Configuration** | Analyzes configuration headers for information disclosure |
| **FrontPage Server Extensions** | Checks for legacy FrontPage extensions |
| **SharePoint Web Services** | Tests 26 web service endpoints for anonymous access |
| **User Enumeration** | Attempts to enumerate users via userdisp.aspx (up to 20 users) |
| **Default Catalogs** | Checks permissions on 3 default _catalogs pages |
| **Default Forms** | Checks permissions on 9 default Forms pages |
| **Default Layouts** | Checks permissions on 64+ default _layouts pages |
| **Search Engine Exposure** | Generates Google dorks to find indexed SharePoint pages |

## Test details

### Server fingerprinting

Identifies the web server software (IIS), technology stack (ASP.NET), and operating system. This information helps attackers identify potential vulnerabilities.

### SharePoint fingerprinting

Detects the SharePoint version from the `MicrosoftSharePointTeamServices` HTTP header. Version detection enables identification of applicable vulnerabilities.

| Version prefix | SharePoint version |
|----------------|-------------------|
| 10.x | SharePoint 2001 |
| 11.x | SharePoint 2003 |
| 12.x | SharePoint 2007 |
| 14.x | SharePoint 2010 |
| 15.x | SharePoint 2013 |
| 16.x | SharePoint 2016/Online |

### SharePoint configuration

Analyzes HTTP response headers for configuration information disclosure:

| Header | Information exposed |
|--------|-------------------|
| **SPRequestDuration** | Request processing time in milliseconds |
| **X-SharePointHealthScore** | Server load status (0-10 scale) |
| **SPIislatency** | Web front-end server latency |
| **SPRequestGuid** | Log correlation ID for troubleshooting |

This information can help attackers monitor the effectiveness of denial-of-service attacks.

### FrontPage Server Extensions

Checks for legacy FrontPage Server Extensions by accessing `/_vti_inf.html`. FrontPage extensions are deprecated and may contain security vulnerabilities.

### SharePoint web services

Tests 26 SharePoint web service endpoints for anonymous access:

- `/_vti_bin/spdisco.aspx`: Web service discovery
- `/_vti_bin/lists.asmx`: List access
- `/_vti_bin/People.asmx`: People service
- `/_vti_bin/UserGroup.asmx`: User/group service
- `/_vti_bin/permissions.asmx`: Permissions service
- `/_vti_bin/search.asmx`: Search service
- And 20 more endpoints...

Exposed web services allow attackers to query SharePoint data without authentication.

### User enumeration

Attempts to enumerate SharePoint users via the `/_layouts/userdisp.aspx` page. For each user found, the scanner extracts:

- Account name
- Full name
- Work email
- Department
- Job title
- Mobile phone

User information enables targeted phishing attacks and brute-force password attacks.

### Default catalogs

Checks anonymous access to default _catalogs pages:

- `/_catalogs/masterpage/Forms/AllItems.aspx`
- `/_catalogs/wp/Forms/AllItems.aspx`
- `/_catalogs/wt/Forms/Common.aspx`

### Default forms

Checks anonymous access to 9 default Forms pages including:

- `Forms/DispForm.aspx`: Display forms
- `Forms/EditForm.aspx`: Edit forms
- `Forms/NewForm.aspx`: New item forms
- `Pages/Forms/AllItems.aspx`: Page listings

### Default layouts

Checks anonymous access to 64+ default _layouts pages (including SharePoint 2013 `/_layouts/15/` paths):

- `_layouts/viewlsts.aspx`: List views
- `_layouts/people.aspx`: People and groups
- `_layouts/settings.aspx`: Site settings
- `_layouts/create.aspx`: Create page
- `_layouts/sitemanager.aspx`: Site manager
- And many more administrative pages...

### Search engine exposure

Generates Google dork queries to find indexed SharePoint pages:

- `site:example.com inurl:"/_catalogs"`
- `site:example.com inurl:"/Forms"`
- `site:example.com inurl:"/_layouts"`

<Note>
The scanner provides clickable Google search links. You should manually review the results to identify any sensitive indexed pages.
</Note>

## How it works

The SharePoint Scanner follows a systematic approach:

1. **Server fingerprinting**: Identifies web server, technology, and OS
2. **SharePoint detection**: Confirms SharePoint installation and determines version
3. **Configuration analysis**: Examines HTTP headers for information disclosure
4. **Extension check**: Tests for legacy FrontPage extensions
5. **Web services scan**: Tests 26 endpoints for anonymous access
6. **User enumeration**: Attempts to extract user information
7. **Permission checks**: Tests access to _catalogs, Forms, and _layouts pages
8. **Search exposure**: Generates Google dorks for manual review

The scan is performed remotely in a black-box manner, simulating an anonymous attacker.

## Why SharePoint security matters

- **Corporate data exposure**: SharePoint often contains sensitive business documents
- **User information leakage**: Exposed user data enables targeted attacks
- **Anonymous access risks**: Misconfigured permissions allow unauthorized access
- **Critical vulnerabilities**: SharePoint has had severe RCE vulnerabilities (CVE-2019-0604, CVE-2023-29357)

## Follow-up actions

After identifying vulnerabilities:

- **Remove version headers**: Eliminate MicrosoftSharePointTeamServices and other identifying headers
- **Disable anonymous access**: Restrict web services and default pages to authenticated users
- **Protect user information**: Disable anonymous access to userdisp.aspx
- **Review permissions**: Audit _catalogs, Forms, and _layouts page permissions
- **Remove FrontPage extensions**: If not needed, remove legacy FrontPage components
- **Review indexed pages**: Check Google dork results and remove sensitive pages from search
- **Scan for exploits**: Run [Sniper](/tools/sniper) to test for SharePoint RCE vulnerabilities
- **Schedule regular scans**: Set up [Scheduled scans](/using/scans/scheduled-scans) for continuous monitoring

<Warning>
SharePoint vulnerabilities can expose sensitive corporate documents and enable remote code execution. Regular security assessments are critical.
