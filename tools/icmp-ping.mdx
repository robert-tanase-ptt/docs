## Overview

The ICMP Ping tool tests whether a target host is reachable over the network using ICMP echo requests.

## What it does

<CardGroup cols={2}>
  <Card title="Reachability" icon="wifi">
    Check if host responds
  </Card>
  <Card title="Latency" icon="clock">
    Measure response time
  </Card>
  <Card title="Packet loss" icon="chart-line">
    Detect connectivity issues
  </Card>
</CardGroup>

## How to use

<Steps>
  <Step title="Enter target">
    Provide IP address or hostname.
  </Step>
  <Step title="Configure options">
    Set packet count and timeout.
  </Step>
  <Step title="Run ping">
    Execute the connectivity test.
  </Step>
  <Step title="Review results">
    Analyze response data.
  </Step>
</Steps>

## Options

| Option | Description | Default |
|--------|-------------|---------|
| Count | Number of packets | 4 |
| Timeout | Wait time per packet | 1 second |
| Size | Packet size | 64 bytes |

## Results include

- Response status (success/failure)
- Round-trip time (RTT)
- Packet loss percentage
- TTL information

## Use cases

- Verify target is online before scanning
- Check network connectivity
- Troubleshoot reachability issues
- Quick host discovery

<Note>
Some hosts block ICMP traffic. A non-responsive ping doesn't necessarily mean the host is down.
</Note>

## Interpreting results

| Result | Meaning |
|--------|---------|
| Reply received | Host is up and reachable |
| Request timeout | Host may be down or blocking ICMP |
| Network unreachable | Routing issue |
| Host unreachable | No route to host |

<Tip>
If ICMP is blocked, try connecting to a known open port to verify host availability.
