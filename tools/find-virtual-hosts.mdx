## Overview

The Virtual Host Finder discovers websites hosted on the same server using virtual hosting, revealing additional attack surface and potential targets.

## What are virtual hosts?

Virtual hosting allows multiple websites to share a single IP address. Each site is served based on the HTTP Host header. This tool discovers these hidden sites that may not be publicly linked.

## What it finds

- Additional websites on shared hosting
- Internal applications exposed on shared servers
- Development sites on production IPs
- Legacy applications still hosted
- Related web properties

## How to use

<Steps>
  <Step title="Enter target">
    Provide an IP address or domain.
  </Step>
  <Step title="Run discovery">
    Execute the virtual host enumeration.
  </Step>
  <Step title="Review results">
    Analyze discovered virtual hosts.
  </Step>
</Steps>

## Discovery methods

| Method | Description |
|--------|-------------|
| **Reverse DNS** | Query PTR records |
| **Certificate analysis** | Extract names from SSL certificates |
| **Historical data** | Search passive DNS databases |
| **Brute force** | Try common hostname patterns |

## Results

For each virtual host:
- Hostname discovered
- HTTP response code
- Page title
- Server header information
- SSL certificate details

<Note>
Virtual hosts may belong to different organizations when using shared hosting providers. Verify ownership before testing.
</Note>

## Security implications

Finding virtual hosts can reveal:
- Cross-site vulnerabilities on shared hosting
- Internal applications exposed unintentionally
- Additional targets within scope
- Weak neighbor sites that could be attack vectors
