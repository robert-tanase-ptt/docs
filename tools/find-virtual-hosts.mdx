## Overview

The Virtual Host Finder discovers websites hosted on the same server using virtual hosting, revealing additional attack surface and potential targets.

## What It Finds

- Additional websites on shared hosting
- Internal applications exposed on shared servers
- Development sites on production IPs
- Legacy applications still hosted
