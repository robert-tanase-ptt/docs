## Cloud Storage Checks

### Amazon S3

- Public bucket detection
- ACL misconfigurations
- Bucket policy issues
- Listing enabled

### Azure Blob Storage

- Public container access
- Anonymous read permissions
- SAS token exposure

### Google Cloud Storage

- Public bucket access
- IAM misconfigurations

## Common Findings

| Finding | Risk | Description |
|---------|------|-------------|
| Public S3 Bucket | Critical | Data exposed to internet |
| Directory Listing | High | Can enumerate contents |
| Weak ACLs | Medium | Overly permissive access |
| Metadata Exposure | Low | Information disclosure |

<Warning>
Publicly accessible cloud storage has caused numerous data breaches. Always verify storage permissions.
</Warning>

## Best Practices

<Tip>
Regularly scan your cloud resources for public exposure, especially after infrastructure changes.
</Tip>

- Enable bucket/container logging
- Use private by default
- Implement least privilege
- Monitor for configuration drift
