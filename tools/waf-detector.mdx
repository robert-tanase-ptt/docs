## Overview

The WAF Detector identifies whether a target website is protected by a Web Application Firewall and attempts to determine which WAF product is in use.

## Why detect WAFs?

## What it detects

### WAF products

Common WAFs detected:
- Cloudflare
- AWS WAF
- Akamai
- Imperva/Incapsula
- F5 BIG-IP ASM
- ModSecurity
- Sucuri
- Barracuda
- Fortinet FortiWeb

### Detection methods

| Method | Description |
|--------|-------------|
| **Response headers** | WAF-specific HTTP headers |
| **Cookie analysis** | WAF session cookies |
| **Error responses** | Characteristic block pages |
| **Behavioral analysis** | Response to test payloads |

## Results

Detection provides:
- WAF detected (yes/no)
- WAF product name
- Confidence level
- Detection method used
- Additional observations

## Testing implications

<Note>
WAF presence doesn't mean a site is secure—WAFs can often be bypassed, and they may not catch all vulnerabilities.
</Note>

### With WAF detected

- Expect more false negatives in vulnerability scans
- Scans may trigger blocks
- Consider WAF bypass techniques for manual testing
- Rate limiting may apply
- Some payloads may be filtered

### No WAF detected

- Direct access to application
- More accurate scan results
- Faster scanning possible
- Full payload testing

## Adjusting your approach

<Tip>
When a WAF is detected, consider slowing down scans and using evasion techniques for manual testing.
</Tip>

- Lower request rates to avoid triggering rules
- Use encoded payloads where appropriate
- Document WAF for the final report
- Note that some vulnerabilities may be blocked but still exist
