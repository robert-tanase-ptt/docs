## Testing Implications

<Note>
WAF presence doesn't mean a site is secure—WAFs can often be bypassed, and they may not catch all vulnerabilities.
</Note>

### With WAF Detected

- Expect more false negatives
- Scans may trigger blocks
- Consider WAF bypass techniques
- Rate limiting may apply

### No WAF Detected

- Direct access to application
- More accurate scan results
- Faster scanning possible
