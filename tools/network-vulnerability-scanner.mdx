## Scan Profiles

| Profile | Speed | Thoroughness | Use Case |
|---------|-------|--------------|----------|
| Discovery | Fast | Low | Host enumeration |
| Quick | Fast | Medium | Quick assessment |
| Full | Slow | High | Comprehensive audit |

## Vulnerability Categories

### By Service Type

| Service | Example Checks |
|---------|----------------|
| SSH | Weak algorithms, outdated versions |
| SMB | EternalBlue, signing disabled |
| RDP | BlueKeep, NLA settings |
| FTP | Anonymous access, clear text |
| Database | Default credentials, public exposure |

### By Severity

- **Critical**: Immediate exploitation possible
- **High**: Significant risk, prioritize
- **Medium**: Moderate risk
- **Low**: Minor issues
- **Info**: Informational findings

## Results Include

For each vulnerability:
- CVE identifier (if applicable)
- CVSS score
- Affected host/service
- Evidence
- Remediation steps
- References

## Internal Network Scanning

<Note>
To scan internal networks, configure a [VPN Profile](/using/vpn/overview) to establish connectivity.
</Note>

<Tip>
Start with a discovery scan to identify live hosts, then run targeted vulnerability scans on discovered systems.
