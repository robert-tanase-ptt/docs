## Overview

The Network Vulnerability Scanner identifies security weaknesses in network infrastructure, including servers, services, and network devices. It tests for known CVEs, misconfigurations, and security issues across network services.

## What it tests

<CardGroup cols={2}>
  <Card title="Service vulnerabilities" icon="server">

## Scan profiles

| Profile | Coverage | Speed | Use case |
|---------|----------|-------|----------|
| **Light** | Common ports, basic checks | Fast | Quick assessment |
| **Deep** | Extended ports, thorough testing | Slower | Comprehensive audit |
| **Custom** | User-configured | Variable | Targeted testing |

### Custom mode engines

In Custom mode, select scanning engines:

- **OpenVAS** — Open-source vulnerability scanner
- **[Sniper](/tools/sniper)** — Custom vulnerability checks

## Vulnerability categories

| Category | Examples |
|----------|----------|
| **Remote code execution** | Log4Shell, EternalBlue, Shellshock |
| **Authentication bypass** | Default credentials, weak authentication |
| **Information disclosure** | Service banners, version exposure |
| **Denial of service** | Resource exhaustion, crash vulnerabilities |
| **Privilege escalation** | Service misconfigurations |
| **Cryptographic issues** | Weak ciphers, deprecated protocols |

## Tested services

Common services scanned:

| Service | Checks |
|---------|--------|
| **SSH** | Weak algorithms, version vulnerabilities |
| **FTP** | Anonymous access, version vulnerabilities |
| **SMB** | EternalBlue, signing, shares |
| **RDP** | BlueKeep, NLA configuration |
| **Databases** | Remote access, authentication |
| **Web servers** | Server vulnerabilities, misconfigurations |
| **Mail servers** | Open relay, authentication |

## Configuration options

### Port selection

| Option | Description |
|--------|-------------|
| **Common ports** | Most frequently used ports |
| **Extended** | Additional service ports |
| **Custom range** | User-defined port range |
| **All ports** | Full 65535 port scan |

### Scanning options

- **Safe checks only** — Avoid potentially disruptive tests
- **Include denial of service checks** — Test for DoS vulnerabilities
- **Brute force** — Test for weak credentials

<Warning>
Denial of service checks may impact target availability. Only enable on systems you have permission to stress test.
</Warning>

## Results

For each vulnerability:
- **CVE ID** — Common Vulnerabilities and Exposures identifier
- **Severity** — CVSS score and rating
- **Affected service** — Port and service information
- **Description** — Detailed vulnerability explanation
- **Solution** — Remediation steps

## Internal network scanning

To scan internal networks, configure a VPN profile:

1. Set up [VPN agent](/using/vpn/overview)
2. Create VPN profile for your network
3. Select VPN profile when running scan

<Note>
Internal network scanning requires a VPN agent deployed in your network.
