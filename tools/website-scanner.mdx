---

## Overview

The Website Scanner performs security testing of web applications. It crawls your application, identifies technologies, and tests for vulnerabilities through active payload injection and passive response analysis.

The Website Scanner is a **vulnerability scanner**: it actively tests web applications for security weaknesses. Discovered technologies are added to your [Attack Surface](/using/attack-surface/attack-surface-overview). Identified vulnerabilities are reported as [findings](/using/findings/findings).

## Supported targets

| Target type | Examples |
|-------------|----------|
| **URL** | `https://example.com`, `https://app.example.com/admin` |

<Note>
The scanner does not follow redirects. Provide the exact URL you want to scan. To scan a specific directory, include it in the URL (e.g., `https://example.com/app/`).
</Note>

## Scan types

<Warning>
The Deep scan performs active vulnerability testing and generates significant network traffic (~10,000+ HTTP requests). Most correctly configured security monitoring systems will detect this scan. Do not use it if you don't have proper authorization from the target website owner.
</Warning>

### Custom scan

Full control over scan parameters:

- Select specific tests to run
- Configure spider settings
- Set request rate limits
- Configure authentication
- Define URL exclusions and inclusions

## Initial tests

Initial tests identify technologies, configuration files, and potential entry points before active vulnerability testing begins. See the [tests comparison table](#tests-comparison) for Light vs Deep availability.

| Test | Description |
|------|-------------|
| **Fingerprint Website** | Identifies web server software, frameworks, CMS platforms, and other technologies using Wappalyzer |

| **[AI-powered endpoint discovery](/ai/endpoint-discovery)** | Uses an AI browser agent to navigate the site and discover endpoints that traditional crawling misses |

<Note>
Some initial tests like "Find interesting files" and "Information disclosure" may take several hours to complete as they test many potential paths.
</Note>

## Passive checks

Passive checks analyze server responses without sending attack payloads. These are safe and non-intrusive. See the [tests comparison table](#tests-comparison) for Light vs Deep availability.

| **Session Token in URL** | Detects session IDs passed in URLs, which can be leaked via referer headers or logs |
| **API Endpoints** | Identifies API endpoints discovered during crawling for further testing |

## Active checks

Active checks send payloads to identify exploitable vulnerabilities. These tests are only available in Deep scan mode. See the [tests comparison table](#tests-comparison) for Light vs Deep availability.

<Warning>
Active checks send attack payloads to your application. Only run these against systems you have explicit authorization to test.

## Engine options

Engine options configure how the spider crawls your application to discover pages, forms, and functionality.

### Spidering approach

| Approach | Description | Use case |
|----------|-------------|----------|
| **Auto** | Automatically detects and uses the best approach | Most applications (default) |
| **Classic** | Traditional HTML parsing and link following | Standard websites |
| **SPA** | JavaScript-aware crawling with browser rendering | React, Angular, Vue apps |

### Limits

| Setting | Description | Range | Default |
|---------|-------------|-------|---------|
| **Spidering Depth** | Maximum crawl depth measured by the number of slashes in the URL | 1-10 | 10 |
| **Maximum spidering time** | Maximum spider duration in seconds | 10-3600 | 3600 (1 hour) |
| **Requests per second** | Rate limit for requests (actual speed may be lower) | 1-10,000 | 100 |

### Included URLs

Add URLs to be included in the spidering process. This allows the scanner to reach endpoints that are hard to find automatically or are not linked with other endpoints.

Enter one URL per line:
```
https://www.example.com/hidden-page
https://www.example.com/service-endpoint/
```

### Excluded URLs

Add URLs to be excluded from the spidering process. This stops the scanner from processing endpoints and limits the scope, making it useful when certain areas do not require scanning for vulnerabilities.

Enter one URL per line:
```
https://www.example.com/docs
https://www.example.com/blog/
```

<Tip>
Always exclude logout URLs, delete actions, and other destructive endpoints to maintain scan stability. Example exclusions: `/logout`, `/signout`, `/delete`, `/remove`.
</Tip>

### Subdomains in scope

Add subdomains of the target to be scanned if requests to them are found during the spidering process. This allows the scanner to expand its scanning scope to specific subdomains of the target.

If left empty, only the subdomain **api** will be considered in scope. For example, if `http://example.com` is the target, the subdomain `api.example.com` will be in scope by default.

## Authentication

Configure authentication to test protected areas of your application. Authentication is available in **Deep** and **Custom** scan modes only.

| Method | Description | Use case |
|--------|-------------|----------|
| **Automatic login form** | Scanner fills and submits your login form | Simple login pages |
| **Recorded authentication** | Replay Chrome Recorder JSON file | Complex multi-step logins |
| **Cookie authentication** | Use existing session cookies | Any cookie-based auth |
| **Header authentication** | Send custom headers (JWT, API keys) | API and token-based auth |

<Note>
For detailed authentication configuration, see [Authenticated scanning](/using/scans/authenticated-scanning#website-scanner).
</Note>

## How it works

The Website Scanner works in these steps:

1. **Fingerprinting**: Identifies web server, technologies, and frameworks
2. **Crawling**: Discovers pages, forms, and functionality using the selected spider approach. Uses [AI-powered soft 404 detection](/ai/soft404detector) to filter out false positives.
3. **Initial testing**: Searches for sensitive files, admin panels, and configuration issues
4. **Passive analysis**: Analyzes all responses for security issues without sending payloads
5. **Active testing**: Injects payloads into parameters to test for vulnerabilities
6. **Reporting**: Generates findings with evidence and remediation guidance

## Follow-up actions

After identifying vulnerabilities:

- **Prioritize by severity**: Address Critical and High findings first
- **Validate findings**: Use [SQLi Exploiter](/tools/sqli-exploiter) to confirm SQL injection
- **Test APIs**: Run [API Scanner](/tools/api-scanner) for REST and GraphQL endpoints
- **Check CMS**: Use [WordPress Scanner](/tools/wordpress-scanner) for WordPress sites
- **Find hidden content**: Run [URL Fuzzer](/tools/url-fuzzer) for additional discovery
- **Schedule regular scans**: Set up [Scheduled scans](/using/scans/scheduled-scans) for continuous monitoring
