## Overview

The Google Hacking tool uses advanced search operators (Google dorks) to discover exposed sensitive information, misconfigurations, and security issues indexed by search engines.

## What it finds

## Dork categories

| Category | What it finds |
|----------|---------------|
| **Sensitive files** | Passwords, configs, backups |
| **Exposed directories** | Open directory indexes |
| **Login pages** | Admin panels, authentication forms |
| **Error pages** | Debug information, stack traces |
| **Database files** | SQL dumps, database exports |
| **Log files** | Access and error logs |
| **Documents** | PDFs, spreadsheets, presentations |

## Example findings

- Exposed configuration files with database credentials
- Publicly accessible admin panels
- Backup files left on web servers (.bak, .old)
- Directory listings revealing site structure
- Debug pages exposing system information
- Exposed source code files
- Database export files (.sql)

<Warning>
Google Hacking searches public indexes. The information found is already publicly accessible, but it may reveal sensitive data that should be protected.
</Warning>

## Why it works

Search engines crawl and index web content. When sensitive files are accidentally exposed:
- Search engines discover and index them
- They become searchable via advanced operators
- Attackers can find them without directly scanning your site

## Best practices

<Tip>
Run Google Hacking scans regularly to detect accidentally exposed files before attackers do.
</Tip>

- **Monitor continuously** — New exposures happen with deployments
- **Remove indexed content** — Request removal from Google after fixing
- **Use robots.txt wisely** — But don't rely on it for security
- **Implement proper access controls** — Authentication and authorization
