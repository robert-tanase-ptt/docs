## Overview

The UDP Port Scanner identifies open UDP ports, which often host critical services that TCP scanning misses.

## Why Scan UDP?

UDP services are frequently overlooked but can be highly vulnerable:

- DNS (53)
- SNMP (161, 162)
- NTP (123)
- TFTP (69)
- VPN services

## UDP vs TCP Scanning

| Aspect | TCP | UDP |
|--------|-----|-----|
| Connection | Stateful | Stateless |
| Speed | Faster | Slower |
| Reliability | High | Variable |
| Response | Clear open/closed | Often no response |

<Note>
UDP scanning is inherently slower and less reliable than TCP scanning because UDP doesn't acknowledge packets.
</Note>

## Common UDP Ports

| Port | Service | Security Concern |
|------|---------|------------------|
| 53 | DNS | Zone transfers, amplification |
| 67/68 | DHCP | Rogue DHCP servers |
| 69 | TFTP | Unauthenticated file access |
| 123 | NTP | Amplification attacks |
| 161 | SNMP | Information disclosure |
| 500 | IKE | VPN vulnerabilities |

## Scan Considerations

<Warning>
UDP scanning takes significantly longer than TCP scanning. Plan accordingly for comprehensive UDP assessments.
