description: "Fingerprint technologies and gather intelligence about web applications"

## Overview

Website Recon identifies server-side and client-side technologies used by a web application. It is primarily a discovery tool, but it also generates [findings](/using/findings/findings) for detected technologies. Discovered technologies are added to your [Attack Surface](/using/attack-surface/attack-surface-overview).

## Parameters

| Parameter | Description |
|-----------|-------------|
| Target URL | The address of the website to analyze. Must start with `http://` or `https://`. |

## How it works

Website Recon uses [Wappalyzer](https://www.wappalyzer.com/) as its scanning engine. Wappalyzer maintains a database of over 900 web technologies across 50+ categories.

The tool analyzes multiple elements of the website:

| Element | What it reveals |
|---------|-----------------|
| **HTTP response headers** | Server software, frameworks, caching layers |
| **HTML Meta Generator tags** | CMS platforms, static site generators |
| **Embedded JavaScript files** | Frontend frameworks, libraries, analytics |
| **HTML content patterns** | Application frameworks, templating engines |
| **HTML comments** | Development tools, build systems |
| **Website favicon** | Platform identification (e.g., WordPress, Drupal) |

The tool also captures a **screenshot** of the website for visual reference.

## Technology categories

Website Recon identifies technologies across many categories:

| Category | Examples |
|----------|----------|
| **CMS** | WordPress, Drupal, Joomla, Wix, Squarespace |
| **Web servers** | nginx, Apache, IIS, LiteSpeed, Caddy |
| **Programming languages** | PHP, Python, Java, Node.js, Ruby, ASP.NET |
| **JavaScript frameworks** | React, Angular, Vue.js, jQuery, Next.js |
| **CSS frameworks** | Bootstrap, Tailwind CSS, Foundation |
| **E-commerce** | Shopify, WooCommerce, Magento, PrestaShop |
| **CDN** | Cloudflare, Akamai, Fastly, AWS CloudFront |
| **Analytics** | Google Analytics, Matomo, Hotjar |
| **Marketing automation** | HubSpot, Mailchimp, Marketo |
| **Security** | reCAPTCHA, Cloudflare Bot Management |
| **Caching** | Varnish, Redis, Memcached |
| **Reverse proxies** | nginx, HAProxy, Envoy |

## How recon results feed into testing

Technology fingerprinting typically happens early in a penetration test. Knowing what software a target runs lets you:

- Use CMS-specific tools when WordPress, Drupal, or Joomla is detected
- Match detected versions against known CVEs
- Plan targeted testing based on the application architecture
- Focus on known-vulnerable components first

<Tip>
When Website Recon detects **WordPress**, a recommendation appears to run the [WordPress Scanner](/tools/wordpress-scanner) for a more thorough CMS-specific assessment.
</Tip>

### Example workflow

If Website Recon finds the following about a target:

```
CMS: WordPress 4.1
Server: Apache 2.2
Operating System: Linux
```

The next steps would be:
1. Check for known vulnerabilities -- WordPress 4.1 has known security issues
2. Run the [WordPress Scanner](/tools/wordpress-scanner) for CMS-specific testing
3. Use the server and OS information to select appropriate exploits

## Follow-up actions

| Discovery | Recommended action |
|-----------|-------------------|
| WordPress | Run [WordPress Scanner](/tools/wordpress-scanner) |
| Drupal | Run [Drupal Scanner](/tools/drupal-scanner) |
| Joomla | Run [Joomla Scanner](/tools/joomla-scanner) |
| API endpoints | Run [API Scanner](/tools/api-scanner) |
| GraphQL | Run [API Scanner](/tools/api-scanner) with GraphQL support |
| Outdated software | Check CVE databases for known vulnerabilities |
| Any web application | Run [Website Scanner](/tools/website-scanner) for full assessment |
| WAF presence suspected | Run [WAF Detector](/tools/waf-detector) to identify protection |
| Hidden content | Run [URL Fuzzer](/tools/url-fuzzer) to discover hidden directories and files |
| HTTPS enabled | Run [SSL/TLS Scanner](/tools/ssl-tls-scanner) to analyze encryption configuration |
