title: "Sniper: Auto-Exploiter"
description: "Automatically exploit known vulnerabilities and extract evidence from compromised systems"
---

## Overview

Sniper is an automated exploitation tool that identifies and exploits known vulnerabilities in high-profile software. After successful exploitation, it automatically extracts artifacts (system information, users, network data) as proof of compromise.

Sniper is an **exploitation tool**: it actively attempts to exploit vulnerabilities to gain remote command execution. It does not add data to your [Attack Surface](/using/attack-surface/attack-surface-overview) or generate [findings](/using/findings/findings). Instead, it produces detailed reports with extracted artifacts as evidence.

## Supported targets

| Target type | Examples |
|-------------|----------|
| **IP address** | `192.168.1.1`, `10.0.0.5` |
| **Hostname** | `server.example.com`, `mail.corp.local` |

## Attack modes

### Unauthenticated mode

Sniper scans for open ports, fingerprints services, and attempts to exploit known vulnerabilities to gain access.

### Authenticated mode

Sniper uses provided credentials to establish a legitimate session and extracts artifacts without exploitation. Useful for post-authentication reconnaissance.

| Protocol | Authentication | Use case |
|----------|----------------|----------|
| **SSH** | Username/password or private key | Linux/Unix systems |
| **WinRM** | Username/password (NTLM or Basic) | Windows systems |
| **SMB** | Username/password with optional domain | Windows file shares |
| **MySQL** | Username/password with database name | Database servers |

## Parameters

### Port selection

| Option | TCP ports | Description |
|--------|-----------|-------------|
| **Top 100 ports** | ~85 | Quick scan (default) |
| **Top 1000 ports** | ~617 | Standard assessment |
| **Top 5000 ports** | ~2,012 | Extended coverage |
| **Full port range** | 65,535 | All ports (slow) |
| **Port range** | Variable | Specify start and end port (e.g., 1-1024) |
| **Port list** | Variable | Comma-separated list (e.g., 22,80,443,3389) |

### Scan options

| Option | Description |
|--------|-------------|
| **Check alive** | Verify the host is reachable before scanning |
| **Safe exploits only** | Exclude exploits that may crash the target (e.g., EternalBlue) |
| **Extensive modules** | Include modules that run longer due to fuzzing (e.g., CVE-2022-42889 Text4Shell) |

### CVE targeting

You can target specific CVEs (up to 10) to focus the scan on particular vulnerabilities. The CVEs must be part of Sniper's exploit module database.

### Extractors

Choose which artifacts to extract after successful exploitation:

| Extractor | Description |
|-----------|-------------|
| **Basic system information** | Current user, computer name, IP, architecture, domain, hotfixes |
| **Local users** | Users configured on the operating system |
| **Processes** | Currently running processes |
| **Screenshot** | Desktop screenshot (Windows only, if user logged in) |
| **Filesystem** | Listing of interesting files and folders |
| **Network data** | Network interfaces, neighbors, connections, services |
| **Interesting files** | Files extracted via Local File Inclusion modules |
| **Secrets** | Information extracted via custom capability modules |

## How it works

Sniper executes a predefined attack workflow:

### 1. Port scanning

Scans the specified TCP ports to identify open services. Results include port number, state, service name, and version.

### 2. Web fingerprinting

For HTTP/HTTPS services, Sniper identifies the web application type (e.g., Outlook Web Access, VMware, Jenkins) and underlying technologies.

### 3. Exploit matching

Based on the fingerprint data, Sniper filters its database to find compatible exploit modules.

### 4. Vulnerability checking

Runs non-destructive checks to determine if the target is actually exploitable.

### 5. Exploitation and extraction

If vulnerable, Sniper exploits the vulnerability to gain remote command execution, then runs extractors to collect artifacts.

### 6. Cleanup

Removes any files or processes created during exploitation to leave the system unaltered.

## Exploit modules

Sniper includes custom exploit modules developed for critical vulnerabilities in widely-used software. These modules target:

- **Web servers and applications**: Apache, IIS, Exchange, SharePoint, Confluence, etc.
- **Network services**: SSH, SMB, RDP, databases
- **Known CVEs**: Actively maintained database of exploitable vulnerabilities

<Warning>
Sniper performs active exploitation. Only use against systems you have explicit authorization to test.
</Warning>

## Artifacts

Artifacts are data extracted from the target system after successful exploitation. They provide solid proof that the target is vulnerable and help with further manual testing.

| Artifact | Description |
|----------|-------------|
| **Current user** | The user context the exploit runs as (e.g., root, SYSTEM) |
| **System information** | OS type, version, kernel, architecture, memory |
| **Local users** | List of configured system users |
| **Running processes** | Active processes with PIDs and owners |
| **Network configuration** | IP addresses, network masks, gateways |
| **Network neighbors** | Devices in the same local network (layer 2) |
| **Network connections** | Open ports and established TCP connections |

## Why use Sniper?

- **Bridge the gap**: Go beyond vulnerability scanners that produce noise and false positives
- **Validate findings**: Prove that a vulnerability is actually exploitable
- **Red team efficiency**: Automate common attack patterns
- **Evidence collection**: Gather artifacts for reports and remediation prioritization

<Tip>
Use "Safe exploits only" when testing production systems to avoid potential service disruption.
</Tip>

## Follow-up actions

After successful exploitation:

- **Prioritize remediation**: Exploitable vulnerabilities require immediate attention
- **Expand testing**: Use extracted network data for lateral movement assessment
- **Run [Network Scanner](/tools/network-scanner)**: Find additional infrastructure issues
- **Document evidence**: Use artifacts for penetration test reports
