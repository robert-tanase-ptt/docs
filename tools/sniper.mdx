## Capabilities

### Reconnaissance

- Subdomain enumeration
- Technology fingerprinting
- Port discovery
- Service identification

### Scanning

- Web vulnerability scanning
- Network vulnerability scanning
- CMS-specific tests
- SSL/TLS analysis

### Exploitation

- Automated exploit selection
- Proof-of-concept execution
- Impact validation

<Warning>
Exploitation features should only be used against systems you have explicit permission to test. Unauthorized exploitation is illegal.
</Warning>

## Results Include

- Full reconnaissance data
- Vulnerability findings
- Exploitation results
- Detailed evidence

## Use Cases

- Penetration testing engagements
- Red team assessments
- Security audits
- Vulnerability validation

<Note>
Sniper automates many manual testing steps but should be complemented with manual testing for comprehensive assessments.
