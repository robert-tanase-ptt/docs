## Capabilities

### Database Enumeration

- List databases
- List tables
- List columns
- Extract records

### Information Gathering

| Info | Description |
|------|-------------|
| DB Version | Database software and version |
| Current User | Database connection user |
| Current DB | Active database name |
| Privileges | User permissions |

### Techniques

- Union-based extraction
- Error-based extraction
- Blind boolean-based
- Blind time-based

## Important Considerations

<Warning>
Only use exploitation tools against systems you have explicit authorization to test. Data extraction may have legal implications even with permission.
</Warning>

### Ethical Guidelines

- Get explicit written permission
- Minimize data extraction
- Handle extracted data securely
- Report findings responsibly

### During Testing

- Document all actions
- Avoid modifying data
- Limit scope to what's needed
- Stop if unexpected issues arise

## Results Include

- Database structure
- Extracted data samples
- Exploitation evidence
- Full request/response logs

<Note>
Use extracted data only for demonstrating impact in reports. Securely delete any sensitive data after the engagement.
