description: "Exploit SQL injection vulnerabilities and extract database contents using SQLMap"
---

## Overview

The SQLi Exploiter confirms SQL injection vulnerabilities and extracts data from databases to demonstrate impact. It provides a web interface for [SQLMap](https://sqlmap.org/), the industry-standard SQL injection exploitation tool.

The SQLi Exploiter is an **offensive tool**: it actively exploits SQL injection vulnerabilities to extract database contents. It does not add data to your [Attack Surface](/using/attack-surface/attack-surface-overview) and does not generate [findings](/using/findings/findings). Results are displayed as a detailed report with extracted data and injection point details.

## Supported targets

| Target type | Examples |
|-------------|----------|
| **URL** | `https://example.com/page.php?id=1` |

<Note>
Provide the exact URL with parameters you want to test. The tool will attempt to identify and exploit vulnerable parameters.
</Note>

## Scan options

### HTTP method

| Method | Description |
|--------|-------------|
| **GET** | Test parameters in the URL query string (default) |
| **POST** | Test parameters in POST data body |

When using POST method, provide the POST data in the format `param1=value1&param2=value2`.

### Enumeration

Select what data to extract from the database:

| Option | Description |
|--------|-------------|
| **Current user** | Database connection username |
| **Current database** | Active database name |
| **Server hostname** | Database server hostname |
| **Banner** | Database version and system information |
| **Users** | List of database users |
| **Passwords** | Password hashes from user tables |
| **Tables** | List of tables in databases |
| **Databases** | List of all databases |

### Light crawling

When enabled, SQLMap crawls the website up to second-level links to discover additional injection points automatically. This is useful when:

- You don't know which exact URL is vulnerable
- You want to test multiple pages from a starting URL
- The vulnerable parameter might be on a linked page

<Note>
Light Crawling increases scan time as it discovers and tests multiple pages. Disable it if you already know the exact vulnerable URL and parameter.
</Note>

## Advanced options

Toggle **Advanced** to access additional configuration:

### Authentication

| Option | Description |
|--------|-------------|
| **Cookie header** | HTTP cookies to include in requests (e.g., `PHPSESSID=abc123; auth=xyz`) |

Use cookies to test authenticated pages or maintain session state during exploitation.

<Note>
For detailed authentication configuration, see [Authenticated scanning](/using/scans/authenticated-scanning).
</Note>

### Injection targeting

| Option | Description |
|--------|-------------|
| **Test parameters** | Comma-separated list of specific parameters to test (e.g., `id,user`). If empty, SQLMap auto-detects parameters. |
| **Database type** | Force testing for a specific database. If unset, SQLMap auto-detects. |

**Supported databases:**

- MySQL
- Oracle
- PostgreSQL
- Microsoft SQL Server
- Microsoft Access
- IBM DB2
- SQLite
- Firebird
- Sybase
- SAP MaxDB
- HSQLDB
- Informix

### Payload generation

| Option | Description |
|--------|-------------|
| **Prefix** | String to prepend to each payload |
| **Suffix** | String to append to each payload |

Use prefix/suffix when the injection point requires specific SQL syntax to close statements or comments.

### Tamper scripts

Modify payloads to bypass WAFs or filters:

| Script | Description |
|--------|-------------|
| **between** | Replace `>` with `NOT BETWEEN 0 AND #` and `=` with `BETWEEN # AND #` |
| **charencode** | URL-encode all characters in the payload |
| **equaltolike** | Replace `=` with `LIKE` |
| **space2comment** | Replace spaces with inline SQL comments `/**/` |
| **base64_encode** | Base64-encode the payload |

### Detection settings

| Option | Range | Description |
|--------|-------|-------------|
| **Level** | 1-5 | Controls injection point diversity. Level 1 tests GET/POST parameters. Level 2 adds cookies. Level 3 adds User-Agent and Referer headers. Higher levels take longer. |
| **Risk** | 1-3 | Controls payload aggressiveness. Risk 2 adds heavy time-based tests. Risk 3 adds OR-based tests that may modify data. Higher risk may impact database availability. |
| **HTTP Code** | 100-599 | HTTP status code that indicates a successful injection (e.g., `200` for normal, `302` for redirect) |

<Warning>
Risk level 3 includes OR-based SQL injection tests that could potentially modify or delete data. Use with caution and only on test environments.
</Warning>

### Techniques

Select which SQL injection techniques to use:

| Technique | Code | Description |
|-----------|------|-------------|
| **Boolean-based blind** | B | Infer data by observing true/false response differences |
| **Error-based** | E | Extract data through database error messages |
| **UNION query** | U | Extract data via UNION SELECT statements |
| **Stacked queries** | S | Execute multiple statements separated by semicolons |
| **Time-based blind** | T | Infer data by measuring response time delays |
| **Inline SQL injection** | Q | Inject into inline SQL queries |

<Tip>
For faster scans, disable techniques you know won't work. For example, if error messages are suppressed, disable Error-based (E).
</Tip>

### Rate limiting

| Option | Range | Description |
|--------|-------|-------------|
| **Delay between attempts** | 0-600 seconds | Wait time between consecutive HTTP requests |

Increase delay to avoid triggering rate limits or intrusion detection systems.

### Form testing

| Option | Description |
|--------|-------------|
| **Test web forms** | When enabled, restricts testing to web forms only. When disabled (default), SQLMap injects payloads into URL parameters, POST data, and HTTP headers. |

## How it works

The SQLi Exploiter follows this process:

1. **Parameter discovery**: Identifies injectable parameters in the URL, POST data, or forms
2. **Injection testing**: Tests various SQL injection techniques against each parameter
3. **Database fingerprinting**: Identifies the database type and version
4. **Data extraction**: Extracts requested information using confirmed injection points
5. **Report generation**: Displays extracted data, injection points, and SQLMap output

The report includes:

- **Summary**: Current user, database, hostname, banner, and DBMS users
- **Databases and Tables**: List of databases with table counts and names
- **Usernames and Passwords**: Extracted credentials from user tables
- **Injection Points**: Vulnerable parameters with technique and payload details
- **Console**: Raw SQLMap output for detailed analysis

## Important considerations

<Warning>
Only use exploitation tools against systems you have explicit written authorization to test. Data extraction may have legal implications even with permission.
</Warning>

### Ethical guidelines

- Get explicit written authorization before testing
- Minimize data extraction, extract only enough to prove the vulnerability
- Handle extracted data securely and delete after engagement
- Report findings responsibly to asset owners
- Document all actions for audit purposes

### During testing

- Avoid modifying or deleting data
- Use lower risk levels on production systems
- Monitor for unintended impact
- Stop immediately if unexpected issues occur

## Follow-up actions

After exploiting SQL injection:

- **Document findings**: Include extracted data samples (sanitized) in reports
- **Assess full scope**: Determine what other data is accessible
- **Test remediation**: Re-test after fixes are applied
- **Check related issues**: SQL injection often indicates broader input validation problems
- **Run [Website Scanner](/tools/website-scanner)**: Check for other web vulnerabilities
- **Use [Sniper](/tools/sniper)**: Test for additional exploitable vulnerabilities
