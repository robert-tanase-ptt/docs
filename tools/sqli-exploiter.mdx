## Overview

The SQLi Exploiter allows you to exploit confirmed SQL injection vulnerabilities to demonstrate impact and extract data. Use this tool after discovering SQLi with the [Website Vulnerability Scanner](/tools/website-vulnerability-scanner).

  <Step title="Select actions">
    Choose what to extract or test.
  </Step>
  <Step title="Execute">
    Run the exploitation.
  </Step>
</Steps>

## Capabilities

### Database enumeration

- List all databases
- List tables in databases
- List columns in tables
- Extract records from tables

### Information gathering

| Info | Description |
|------|-------------|
| **DB Version** | Database software and version |
| **Current User** | Database connection user |
| **Current DB** | Active database name |
| **Privileges** | User permissions and roles |

### Exploitation techniques

- **Union-based** — Extract data via UNION SELECT
- **Error-based** — Extract data via error messages
- **Boolean-based blind** — Infer data via true/false responses
- **Time-based blind** — Infer data via response delays

## Important considerations

<Warning>
Only use exploitation tools against systems you have explicit authorization to test. Data extraction may have legal implications even with permission.
</Warning>

### Ethical guidelines

- Get explicit written permission
- Minimize data extraction (sample only)
- Handle extracted data securely
- Report findings responsibly
- Delete sensitive data after engagement

### During testing

- Document all actions
- Avoid modifying data
- Limit scope to demonstration needs
- Stop if unexpected issues arise

## Authentication

Test SQL injection on authenticated pages by providing session cookies.

**How to configure:**
1. In the scan configuration, expand **Advanced** options
2. Enter your session cookie in the **Cookie** field

**Format:**
```
PHPSESSID=abc123; auth_token=xyz789
```

<Note>
The SQLi Exploiter uses cookies to maintain session state while testing vulnerable parameters on authenticated pages.

## Results

Exploitation produces:
- Database structure information
- Sample extracted data
- Exploitation evidence
- Full request/response logs

<Note>
Use extracted data only for demonstrating impact in security reports. Securely delete any sensitive data after the engagement concludes.
</Note>
