## Overview

The Subdomain Takeover scanner detects subdomains vulnerable to takeover attacks, where attackers can claim abandoned cloud resources to serve malicious content from your domain.

## What is subdomain takeover?

Subdomain takeover occurs when:
1. A subdomain points to a cloud service (AWS, Azure, Heroku, etc.)
2. The cloud resource is deleted or unclaimed
3. An attacker claims the resource
4. Attacker now controls content on your subdomain

## Commonly affected services

| Service | Indicator |
|---------|-----------|
| **AWS S3** | NoSuchBucket error |
| **AWS CloudFront** | Bad request, distribution not found |
| **GitHub Pages** | 404 There isn't a GitHub Pages site here |
| **Heroku** | No such app |
| **Azure** | NXDOMAIN on azurewebsites.net |
| **Shopify** | Sorry, this shop is unavailable |
| **Fastly** | Fastly error: unknown domain |
| **Ghost** | Domain not configured |
| **Tumblr** | There's nothing here |

## Detection methods

| Method | Description |
|--------|-------------|
| **CNAME analysis** | Check if CNAME target is claimable |
| **Response fingerprinting** | Match error pages to vulnerable services |
| **DNS resolution** | Detect NXDOMAIN responses |

## Results

For each vulnerable subdomain:
- **Subdomain** — Affected hostname
- **Service** — Cloud provider/service
- **CNAME** — DNS target
- **Status** — Vulnerability confirmation
- **Risk** — Takeover feasibility

## Risk and impact

Successful takeover allows attackers to:
- **Serve malicious content** from your domain
- **Steal cookies** set on parent domain
- **Phish users** with legitimate-looking URLs
- **Bypass security controls** that trust your domain
- **Damage reputation** through defacement

<Warning>
Subdomain takeover enables cookie theft for your entire domain if cookies are set without proper domain restrictions.
</Warning>

## Remediation

When vulnerabilities are found:
1. **Remove dangling DNS records** — Delete CNAMEs pointing to unclaimed resources
2. **Reclaim resources** — If still needed, recreate the cloud resource
3. **Monitor continuously** — Set up alerts for DNS changes
4. **Audit regularly** — Review DNS records and cloud assets
