## Overview

The Subdomain Takeover tool identifies subdomains vulnerable to takeover, where an attacker could claim control of a subdomain pointing to an unclaimed resource.

## What Is Subdomain Takeover?

Subdomain takeover occurs when:
1. A subdomain points to an external service (CNAME)
2. The service account/resource is deleted or unclaimed
3. An attacker can claim the resource
4. They now control content on your subdomain

## Commonly Affected Services

| Service | Takeover Risk |
|---------|---------------|
| GitHub Pages | High |
| Heroku | High |
| AWS S3 | High |
| Azure | Medium |
| Shopify | Medium |
| Fastly | Medium |
| Zendesk | Low |

## Detection Methods

1. **DNS Resolution**: Check CNAME records
2. **HTTP Response**: Look for service-specific error pages
3. **Fingerprinting**: Match known takeover signatures
4. **Validation**: Verify resource is actually unclaimed

## Results Include

For each vulnerable subdomain:
- Subdomain name
- CNAME target
- Service identified
- Takeover risk level
- Validation status

## Risk and Impact

<Warning>
Subdomain takeover can lead to cookie theft, phishing attacks, and reputation damage. The attacker controls content on your domain.
</Warning>

### Potential Impact

| Impact | Description |
|--------|-------------|
| Cookie Theft | Steal session cookies scoped to parent domain |
| Phishing | Host convincing phishing pages |
| Malware | Distribute malware from trusted domain |
| SEO Damage | Deface with inappropriate content |

## Remediation

1. Remove unused DNS records
2. Verify all CNAME targets are claimed
3. Monitor for new dangling records
4. Use DNS monitoring tools
