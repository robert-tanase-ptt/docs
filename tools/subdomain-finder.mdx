## Enumeration Methods

| Method | Description | Coverage |
|--------|-------------|----------|
| DNS Brute Force | Try common subdomain names | High volume |
| Certificate Transparency | Search CT logs | Historical |
| DNS Zone Transfer | Request zone data | When allowed |
| Search Engine | Query indexed subdomains | Public only |
| Passive Sources | Aggregate from databases | Comprehensive |

## Results Include

For each subdomain:
- Full subdomain name
- IP address(es)
- HTTP status (if web server)
- Technologies detected
- Discovery source

## Example Results

```
www.example.com     → 192.168.1.1   → HTTP 200
api.example.com     → 192.168.1.2   → HTTP 200
staging.example.com → 192.168.1.3   → HTTP 403
mail.example.com    → 192.168.1.4   → SMTP
```

## Why Subdomain Enumeration Matters

<Warning>
Organizations often have significantly more subdomains than they realize. Unknown subdomains can harbor vulnerable, unpatched services.
</Warning>

## Best Practices

<Tip>
Run subdomain enumeration regularly to detect newly deployed services and forgotten assets.
