description: "Discover email addresses and social media profiles associated with a target"

## Overview

People Hunter identifies people associated with a target organization by discovering publicly exposed email addresses and social media profiles. It combines web crawling with external API queries to build a list of contacts.

People Hunter is a **discovery tool**: it gathers publicly available contact information but does not test for vulnerabilities. It does not add data to your [Attack Surface](/using/attack-surface/attack-surface-overview) or generate [findings](/using/findings/findings).

## Parameters

| Parameter | Description |
|-----------|-------------|
| Target | IP address or hostname to scan |

## How it works

<Steps>
  <Step title="Port discovery">
    Scans port 443 to check if the target runs an HTTPS web server.
  </Step>
  <Step title="Hostname extraction">
    If scanning an IP address, extracts the hostname from the SSL certificate's Common Name (CN).
  </Step>
  <Step title="API queries">
    Queries the [Tomba.io](https://tomba.io/) API to retrieve indexed email addresses associated with the domain.
  </Step>
  <Step title="Web crawling">
    Uses the Katana crawler to discover and crawl pages on the target website (up to 10 minutes).
  </Step>
  <Step title="Information extraction">
    Searches crawled content for email addresses and social media profile links using regex patterns.
  </Step>
  <Step title="Validation">
    Validates discovered emails by performing DNS MX lookups and filters out emails from external domains.
  </Step>
  <Step title="Pattern analysis">
    Groups discovered emails by username patterns and calculates the percentage of each pattern.
  </Step>
</Steps>

### Email discovery

The tool discovers emails using two techniques:

| Technique | Description |
|-----------|-------------|
| **Active** | Regex pattern matching in crawled web pages (HTML, JavaScript, JSON, XML) |
| **Passive** | External API queries via [Tomba.io](https://tomba.io/) for indexed email addresses |

Discovered emails are:
- **Validated** via DNS MX lookup (domain must have valid mail servers)
- **Filtered** to only include emails matching the target domain
- **Organized** by username pattern

### Username patterns

Emails are analyzed and grouped by their local part format:

| Pattern | Example |
|---------|---------|
| **Single name** | `john@company.com` |
| **First and last name with dot** | `john.doe@company.com` |
| **First and last name with underscore** | `john_doe@company.com` |
| **First and last name with hyphen** | `john-doe@company.com` |
| **Unidentified pattern** | Other formats (e.g., `jdoe123@company.com`) |

The pattern analysis shows the percentage of emails following each format, helping you predict email addresses for other employees.

### Social media profiles

The tool identifies links to social media profiles by matching URL patterns in crawled content:

| Platform | Detected URLs |
|----------|---------------|
| **LinkedIn** | `linkedin.com/in/`, `linkedin.com/company/` |
| **Facebook** | `facebook.com/`, `fb.com/`, `m.facebook.com/` |
| **Twitter/X** | `twitter.com/` |
| **Instagram** | `instagram.com/` |

<Note>
The tool filters out non-profile URLs like share buttons, login pages, and embedded content to reduce false positives.
</Note>

<Warning>
Use discovered information responsibly and in accordance with applicable laws. Always ensure you have proper authorization before using this data for security testing.
</Warning>

## Technical details

- **Port scanned**: 443 (HTTPS)
- **Crawl duration**: Up to 10 minutes per port
- **Crawler**: Katana (high-speed web crawler)
- **Email validation**: DNS MX record lookup with 2-second timeout
- **Content types scanned**: HTML, JavaScript, JSON, XML

## Limitations

- Only scans port 443 by default
- Requires an HTTPS web server on the target
- Email discovery depends on publicly accessible content
- Tomba API has rate limits that may affect results
- Social media detection is limited to major platforms

## Follow-up actions

After discovering people and contact information:

1. **Expand your search**: Use [Google Hacking](/tools/google-hacking) to find additional exposed data on paste sites and code repositories
2. **Fingerprint technologies**: Run [Website Recon](/tools/website-recon) to understand the target's technology stack
3. **Discover more subdomains**: Use [Subdomain Finder](/tools/subdomain-finder) to find additional subdomains that may expose more contacts
4. **Find related domains**: Use [Domain Finder](/tools/domain-finder) to discover other domains owned by the organization
5. **Test credentials**: With proper authorization, use [Password Auditor](/tools/password-auditor) for credential testing
