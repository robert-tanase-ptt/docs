## Detection Methodology

### Reflected XSS

1. Identify input points
2. Inject test payloads
3. Analyze response for reflection
4. Validate execution context

### Stored XSS

1. Submit payloads to storage points
2. Retrieve stored data
3. Check for payload execution
4. Verify persistence

### DOM-based XSS

1. Analyze JavaScript sources
2. Trace data flow to sinks
3. Test for unsafe DOM manipulation

## Payload Categories

| Category | Examples | Use Case |
|----------|----------|----------|
| Basic | `<script>alert(1)</script>` | Simple detection |
| Encoded | URL, HTML, Unicode encoding | Filter bypass |
| Event-based | `onerror`, `onload` | Attribute injection |
| Polyglot | Multi-context payloads | Broad detection |

## Results Include

For each XSS finding:
- XSS type (reflected/stored/DOM)
- Injection point
- Working payload
- Vulnerable parameter
- Evidence
- Remediation steps

## Understanding Impact

<Warning>
XSS can lead to session hijacking, credential theft, malware distribution, and defacement. Treat all XSS findings seriously.
</Warning>

| Impact | Description |
|--------|-------------|
| Session Theft | Steal user cookies |
| Phishing | Display fake login forms |
| Keylogging | Capture user input |
| Malware | Redirect to malicious sites |
