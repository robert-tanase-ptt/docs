## Overview

The Password Auditor tests network services for weak, default, or commonly used passwords. It helps identify authentication weaknesses before attackers do.

## What it tests

## How to use

<Steps>
  <Step title="Enter target">
    Provide IP address or hostname.
  </Step>
  <Step title="Select services">
    Choose which services to test.
  </Step>
  <Step title="Configure credentials">
    Select password lists and usernames.
  </Step>
  <Step title="Run audit">

  </Step>
</Steps>

## Password lists

| List | Size | Description |
|------|------|-------------|
| **Default** | Small | Vendor default credentials |
| **Common** | Medium | Frequently used passwords |
| **Custom** | Variable | Your own credential list |

## Important considerations

<Warning>
Password testing can lock out accounts. Always coordinate with system owners and understand lockout policies before testing.
</Warning>

### Rate limiting

Many services implement:
- Account lockout after failed attempts
- IP-based rate limiting
- CAPTCHA after failures
- Increasing delays between attempts

### Legal requirements

- Get explicit written authorization
- Document scope and limitations
- Follow responsible disclosure
- Report findings appropriately

## Results

For each successful authentication:
- **Service** — Tested service type
- **Host** — Target IP/hostname
- **Port** — Service port
- **Username** — Working username
- **Password** — Working password
- **Risk** — Severity rating

## Common findings

| Finding | Risk | Action |
|---------|------|--------|
| Default admin password | Critical | Change immediately |
| Weak password | High | Enforce password policy |
| Common password | High | Implement password requirements |
| No lockout policy | Medium | Enable account lockout |

<Tip>
Test production systems with caution. Consider testing a single credential first to verify the service won't lock out.
