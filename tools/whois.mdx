description: "Look up domain registration and IP ownership information"

## Overview

The WHOIS Lookup tool retrieves registration information for domains and IP addresses from internet registrars, providing ownership details, contact information, and administrative data.

WHOIS Lookup is a **utility tool**: it queries public registration databases. It does not add data to your [Attack Surface](/using/attack-surface/attack-surface-overview) and does not generate [findings](/using/findings/findings). Results are displayed as raw WHOIS output.

## Supported targets

| Target type | Examples |
|-------------|----------|
| **Domain** | `example.com`, `corp.example.org` |
| **IP address** | `192.168.1.1`, `8.8.8.8` |

## How it works

The tool queries the appropriate internet registrar for the target:

```bash
whois -H <target>
```

For domains, it queries domain registrars (Verisign, ICANN, etc.). For IP addresses, it queries Regional Internet Registries (ARIN, RIPE, APNIC, etc.).

## Information retrieved

### For domains

| Field | Description |
|-------|-------------|
| **Registrar** | Company that registered the domain |
| **Created** | Domain registration date |
| **Expires** | Domain expiration date |
| **Updated** | Last modification date |
| **Name servers** | DNS servers for the domain |
| **Status** | Domain status codes (clientTransferProhibited, etc.) |
| **Registrant** | Owner name and organization |
| **Admin contact** | Administrative contact details |
| **Tech contact** | Technical contact details |

### For IP addresses

| Field | Description |
|-------|-------------|
| **Network** | IP range/CIDR block |
| **Organization** | Company that owns the IP block |
| **Country** | Geographic location |
| **Address** | Organization address |
| **Abuse contact** | Email for reporting abuse |
| **Technical contact** | Technical support contact |

<Note>
Many domain registrations use privacy protection services (like WhoisGuard or PrivacyProtect) that hide actual registrant details. This is normal and expected.

## Why use WHOIS Lookup

### Reconnaissance

- **Identify target organization**: Confirm who owns a domain or IP
- **Find related infrastructure**: Discover IP ranges owned by the same organization
- **Email patterns**: Identify email formats for username guessing
- **Technical contacts**: Find security team contacts for responsible disclosure

### Scope validation

- **Verify ownership**: Confirm targets belong to the organization in scope
- **Identify boundaries**: Determine IP ranges that are in or out of scope
- **Check subsidiaries**: Find related domains owned by the same entity

### Security research

- **Domain age**: Newly registered domains may indicate phishing
- **Expiration dates**: Expiring domains could be takeover targets
- **Historical changes**: Registration changes may indicate compromise

## Follow-up actions

After retrieving WHOIS data:

- **Run [Domain Finder](/tools/domain-finder)**: Discover related domains owned by the same organization
- **Run [Subdomain Finder](/tools/subdomain-finder)**: Enumerate subdomains for discovered domains
- **Check IP ranges**: Use identified CIDR blocks to find additional assets
- **Research contacts**: Use discovered emails for social engineering assessment scope
