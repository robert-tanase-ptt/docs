## Overview

The API uses Bearer token authentication. Include your API key in the `Authorization` header of every request.

<Note>
API access requires a plan that includes it. If you receive a 403 "Your plan does not have API access" error, check your subscription.
</Note>

## Getting your API key

<Steps>
  <Step title="Log In">
    Access your Pentest-Tools.com account.
  </Step>
  <Step title="Go to API Settings">
    Navigate to **My Account → API**.
  </Step>
  <Step title="Create a Key">
    Click **Create API Key**, give it a name, and optionally set an expiration date.
  </Step>
  <Step title="Copy and Store">
    Copy your key immediately. It won't be shown again.
  </Step>
</Steps>

## Using the API Key

Include the key in the `Authorization` header with the `Bearer` prefix:

```
Authorization: Bearer YOUR_API_KEY
```

### Example request

```python
import requests

API_KEY = "YOUR_API_KEY"
API_URL = "https://app.pentest-tools.com/api/v2"

response = requests.get(
    f"{API_URL}/targets",
    headers={"Authorization": f"Bearer {API_KEY}"}
)

print(response.json())
```

## API Key Security

<Warning>
Treat your API key like a password. Never commit it to version control or expose it in client-side code.
</Warning>

### Best practices

| Practice | Description |
|----------|-------------|
| Environment Variables | Store keys in environment variables, not in code |
| Rotation | Rotate keys periodically |
| Expiration | Set expiration dates on keys |
| Naming | Use descriptive names to identify key purpose |
| Monitoring | Check "Last used" date in My Account → API |

### Managing keys

From **My Account → API** you can:

- Create multiple keys for different purposes (CI/CD, scripts, integrations)
- View when each key was last used
- Set expiration dates (1-365 days, or never)
- Revoke compromised keys immediately

## Authentication errors

| Code | Message | Solution |
|------|---------|----------|
| 401 | Unauthorized | API key is missing or invalid |
| 403 | Your plan does not have API access | Upgrade to a plan with API access |
| 403 | Forbidden | Valid key but insufficient permissions for the action |
