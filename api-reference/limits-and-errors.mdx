## Rate Limits

API requests are rate limited to ensure fair usage and platform stability. Limits are applied per user.

### Request Rate Limits

| Endpoint Type | Limit |
|---------------|-------|
| GET requests | 250 requests/minute |
| POST and DELETE requests | 125 requests/minute |
| `/scans/{id}/output` | 60 requests/minute |

<Note>
Pentest Robots have no rate limit when stopping scans via the API.
</Note>

### Rate Limit Headers

You can inspect your current rate limit status by checking the response headers on any request:

| Header | Description |
|--------|-------------|
| `X-RateLimit-Limit` | Maximum requests allowed per minute |
| `X-RateLimit-Remaining` | Requests remaining in current window |

```
X-RateLimit-Limit: 250
X-RateLimit-Remaining: 245
```

### When Rate Limited

When you exceed the rate limit, you'll receive a `429 Too Many Requests` response with additional headers:

| Header | Description |
|--------|-------------|
| `X-RateLimit-Reset` | Unix timestamp when the limit resets |
| `Retry-After` | Seconds to wait before retrying |

**Best Practice**: Implement exponential backoff:

```python
import time
import requests

def api_request_with_retry(url, headers, max_retries=3):
    for attempt in range(max_retries):
        response = requests.get(url, headers=headers)

        if response.status_code == 429:
            retry_after = int(response.headers.get('Retry-After', 2 ** attempt))
            time.sleep(retry_after)
            continue

        return response

    raise Exception("Max retries exceeded")
```

## Error Response Format

Error responses include a `status` code and `message`, with optional `details`:

```json
{
  "status": 400,
  "message": "No tool_id specified"
}
```

With additional details:

```json
{
  "status": 404,
  "message": "Invalid target_id",
  "details": "Target was not found"
}
```

## Error Codes

| Code | Meaning | Common Causes |
|------|---------|---------------|
| 400 | Bad Request | Missing required parameters, invalid input format |
| 401 | Unauthorized | Missing or invalid API key |
| 403 | Forbidden | Valid API key but insufficient permissions |
| 404 | Not Found | Resource doesn't exist or you don't have access |
| 406 | Not Acceptable | Requested format not supported (e.g., JSON output for raw-only tools) |
| 409 | Conflict | Operation conflicts with current state (e.g., deleting running scan) |
| 422 | Unprocessable Entity | Validation failed for the request body |
| 429 | Too Many Requests | Rate limit exceeded |
| 500 | Internal Server Error | Server-side issue; retry later |

## Common Errors

<AccordionGroup>
  <Accordion title="401 Unauthorized">
    **Cause**: Invalid or missing API key

    **Solution**: Verify your API key is correct and included in the Authorization header as `Bearer YOUR_API_KEY`
  </Accordion>

  <Accordion title="403 Forbidden">
    **Cause**: Your API key lacks permission for this action

    **Solutions**:
    - Check your subscription plan includes the requested feature
    - Verify you have access to the workspace or resource
    - For target deletion: ensure your plan allows API target deletion
  </Accordion>

  <Accordion title="404 Not Found">
    **Cause**: Resource doesn't exist or you don't have access

    **Solutions**:
    - Verify the resource ID is correct
    - Check the resource belongs to your account or a workspace you have access to
    - For scans/targets: ensure they haven't been deleted
  </Accordion>

  <Accordion title="406 Not Acceptable">
    **Cause**: Requested output format not supported

    **Example**: Requesting JSON output for a tool that only provides raw output

    **Solution**: Use a different output format or download the PDF report instead
  </Accordion>

  <Accordion title="409 Conflict">
    **Cause**: Operation conflicts with current resource state

    **Examples**:
    - Deleting a scan that is still running
    - Creating a workspace with a name that already exists
    - Deleting your current active workspace

    **Solution**: Resolve the conflict (e.g., stop the scan first) before retrying
  </Accordion>

  <Accordion title="429 Too Many Requests">
    **Cause**: Rate limit exceeded

    **Solution**: Wait for the duration specified in the `Retry-After` header before making more requests
  </Accordion>
</AccordionGroup>

## Best Practices

<Tip>
Always check the `status` field in error responses to determine the appropriate action.
</Tip>

- **Handle errors gracefully**: Implement proper error handling for all API calls
- **Respect rate limits**: Monitor `X-RateLimit-Remaining` and slow down before hitting limits
- **Use exponential backoff**: When retrying failed requests, increase wait time between attempts
- **Log errors**: Keep records of errors for debugging and monitoring
