<Info>
Finding templates are available on the **Pentest Suite** plan. [View plans](/plans-and-limits/plan-overview)
</Info>

## Overview

Finding templates allow you to create reusable vulnerability definitions that standardize how security findings are documented across your organization. Instead of manually entering the same vulnerability details repeatedly, you can save templates and apply them when creating new findings.

## Template Types

There are two types of templates available:

| Type | Description |
|------|-------------|
| **Default** | Pre-built templates provided by Pentest-Tools.com covering common vulnerabilities |
| **Custom** | Templates you create for your organization's specific needs |

## Template Fields

Each finding template contains the following information:

### Core Details

| Field | Required | Description |
|-------|----------|-------------|
| **Name** | Yes | Descriptive name for the vulnerability |
| **Risk Level** | Yes | Severity rating (Critical, High, Medium, Low, Info) |
| **Description** | No | Detailed explanation of the vulnerability |
| **Risk Description** | No | Why this vulnerability poses a security concern |
| **Recommendation** | No | How to fix or mitigate the issue |

### Standards and Scoring

| Field | Description |
|-------|-------------|
| **CVE** | Common Vulnerabilities and Exposures identifier (e.g., CVE-2024-1234) |
| **CWE** | Common Weakness Enumeration identifier (e.g., CWE-79) |
| **CVSS v2** | Common Vulnerability Scoring System v2 score (0-10) |
| **CVSS v3** | Common Vulnerability Scoring System v3 score (0-10) |
| **OWASP 2017** | OWASP Top 10 2017 classification |
| **OWASP 2021** | OWASP Top 10 2021 classification |

### Threat Intelligence

| Field | Description |
|-------|-------------|
| **EPSS Score** | Exploit Prediction Scoring System score (0-1) |
| **EPSS Percentile** | Percentile ranking compared to other vulnerabilities |
| **In CISA KEV** | Whether the vulnerability is in CISA's Known Exploited Vulnerabilities catalog |

### Evidence and Reproduction

| Field | Description |
|-------|-------------|
| **Evidence** | Proof of the vulnerability (request/response data, screenshots) |
| **How to Reproduce** | Steps to reproduce the vulnerability |
| **References** | Links to additional documentation and resources |

## Creating a Template

<Steps>
  <Step title="Navigate to Templates">
    Go to **Findings** → **Templates** in the main navigation.
  </Step>
  <Step title="Click Create Template">
    Click the **Create Template** button.
  </Step>
  <Step title="Fill in Template Details">
    Enter the vulnerability information you want to save:
    - Provide a descriptive name
    - Set the appropriate risk level
    - Add description, recommendation, and other relevant fields
  </Step>
  <Step title="Save the Template">
    Click **Save** to create your template.
  </Step>
</Steps>

<Tip>
When creating a finding, check the **Save as template** option to automatically create a template from that finding's details.
</Tip>

## Using a Template

When you create a new finding, you can select a template to pre-populate the form:

<Steps>
  <Step title="Start Creating a Finding">
    Go to **Findings** and click **Add Finding**.
  </Step>
  <Step title="Select a Template">
    Choose from your custom templates or default templates. Use the search to filter by name.
  </Step>
  <Step title="Review and Customize">
    The form will be populated with the template data. Modify any fields as needed for this specific finding.
  </Step>
  <Step title="Add Target-Specific Details">
    Fill in target-specific information like the affected asset, port, and specific evidence.
  </Step>
  <Step title="Save the Finding">
    Click **Save** to create the finding.
  </Step>
</Steps>

## Managing Templates

### Filtering Templates

Filter your template list by:
- **Name**: Search for templates by name
- **Type**: Show only default or custom templates

### Editing Templates

To edit a custom template:

1. Navigate to **Findings** → **Templates**
2. Find the template you want to edit
3. Click the edit icon
4. Make your changes
5. Click **Save**

<Note>
Default templates provided by Pentest-Tools.com cannot be edited. Create a custom template if you need to modify the content.
</Note>

### Deleting Templates

To delete a custom template:

1. Navigate to **Findings** → **Templates**
2. Find the template you want to delete
3. Click the delete icon
4. Confirm the deletion

<Warning>
Deleting a template does not affect findings that were created using that template. The deletion is permanent and cannot be undone.
</Warning>

## Best Practices

<AccordionGroup>
  <Accordion title="Standardize Naming Conventions">
    Use consistent naming patterns for your templates. Include the vulnerability type and any relevant context (e.g., "SQL Injection - Blind Boolean-based").
  </Accordion>
  <Accordion title="Include Complete References">
    Add CVE, CWE, and OWASP classifications to help with compliance reporting and vulnerability tracking.
  </Accordion>
  <Accordion title="Document Reproduction Steps">
    Include clear, step-by-step instructions in the "How to Reproduce" field. This helps team members validate findings and demonstrates impact to stakeholders.
  </Accordion>
  <Accordion title="Use Templates for Recurring Vulnerabilities">
    Create templates for vulnerabilities you encounter frequently during pentests to save time and ensure consistent documentation.
  </Accordion>
  <Accordion title="Keep Recommendations Actionable">
    Write specific, actionable remediation guidance rather than generic advice.
  </Accordion>
</AccordionGroup>

## Use Cases

### Penetration Testing Teams

Create templates for vulnerabilities commonly found during engagements:
- Authentication bypass techniques
- Injection vulnerabilities
- Misconfigurations
- Business logic flaws

### Compliance Reporting

Standardize how compliance-related findings are documented:
- Include relevant compliance framework references
- Ensure consistent severity ratings
- Add standard remediation guidance

### Knowledge Sharing

Build an organizational knowledge base of vulnerability templates:
- Share proven exploitation techniques
- Document company-specific security policies
- Maintain consistent reporting quality across team members
