description: "View, triage, and manage security findings discovered by your scans"
---

Findings are security vulnerabilities and issues discovered during scans. The findings list is where you review and triage all discovered issues across your assets.

## Viewing findings

Each finding in the list displays:

| Column | Description |
|--------|-------------|
| **Finding** | Name of the vulnerability with a verified indicator |
| **Target** | The target where the finding was discovered |
| **Status** | Current triage status |
| **Risk level** | Severity rating (Critical, High, Medium, Low, Info) |
| **Source** | Scanner or source that detected the issue (e.g., Website Scanner, manually added) |
| **Scan date** | When the finding was discovered |

### Filtering and sorting

Use filters to focus on what matters:

- **By risk level**: View only Critical and High findings, exclude informational items
- **By status**: Track remediation progress (Open, Fixed, Accepted, etc.)
- **By target**: Scope to specific targets
- **By source**: Filter by scanner type or manually added findings
- **By verified status**: Show only verified or unverified findings
- **By scan date**: Filter by when findings were discovered

<Tip>
Start your triage by filtering for Critical and High severity findings. These represent the greatest risk to your organization.
</Tip>

## Finding details

Select any finding to view full details:

- **Description**: What the vulnerability is and why it's a security concern
- **Evidence**: Proof of the vulnerability (request/response data, screenshots, payloads)
- **How to reproduce**: Steps to reproduce the vulnerability
- **Risk description**: Explanation of the potential impact
- **Recommendation**: Guidance on how to fix the issue
- **References**: Links to CVE entries, CWE classifications, OWASP documentation

Additional metadata fields include Port, Protocol, Service, CVSS scores, CVE, CWE, EPSS score, CISA KEV status, and OWASP classifications.

## Actions

### Change status

Update the finding's lifecycle status:

| Status | Description | When to use |
|--------|-------------|-------------|
| **Open** | Active finding requiring attention | Default status for new findings |
| **Fixed** | Remediated and verified | Issue has been resolved |
| **Accepted** | Risk acknowledged | No action planned, document rationale |
| **Ignored** | Intentionally excluded | Not relevant to current scope |
| **False Positive** | Not a real vulnerability | Incorrect detection |

<Warning>
Document all risk acceptance decisions with clear rationale and approval from appropriate stakeholders.
</Warning>

### Change risk level

Adjust the severity rating if the automated assessment doesn't match the actual risk in your environment. Consider factors like:

- Business context and asset criticality
- Compensating controls in place
- Actual exploitability in your environment

### Add notes and comments

Document your findings with:

- Validation details and reproduction steps
- Remediation notes and progress updates
- Team communication and handoff information

### Rescan to verify fixes

<Steps>
  <Step title="Apply the fix">
    Implement the recommended remediation.
  </Step>
  <Step title="Rescan the target">
    Run a targeted scan to verify the fix worked.
  </Step>
  <Step title="Update status">
    Mark as Fixed if remediation is successful.
  </Step>
</Steps>

### Bulk operations

Select multiple findings from the list to apply changes in batch. All bulk operations are available from the toolbar that appears when you select findings.

| Operation | What it does |
|-----------|-------------|
| **Change status** | Set the same status on all selected findings |
| **Change risk level** | Override severity for all selected findings |
| **Change verified** | Mark selected findings as verified or unverified |
| **Send to [Jira](/integrations/jira)** | Creates one Jira ticket per selected finding |
| **Send to [Nucleus](/integrations/nucleus)** | Sends selected findings to a Nucleus project |
| **Clone** | Duplicates each selected finding |
| **Delete** | Removes selected findings (manually added and Burp imports only) |
| **Generate report** | Creates a report from the selected findings |

<Note>
Status, risk level, and verified changes automatically propagate to duplicate findings in the same group. You don't need to update duplicates individually.
</Note>

<Warning>
Findings created by scans cannot be deleted from the findings list. To remove them, delete the scan that produced them.
</Warning>

## Add manual findings

<Info>
Manual findings are available on the **Pentest Suite** plan. [View plans](/plans-and-limits/plan-overview)
</Info>

Create findings manually for vulnerabilities discovered through manual testing that automated scanners can't detect. Use [finding templates](/using/findings/templates) to standardize documentation and save time.

## Deduplication

When running multiple scans, the same vulnerability may be detected more than once. Findings are automatically grouped as duplicates when they match on:

- Vulnerability type
- Location (same asset and URL/endpoint)
- Affected parameter

<Note>
Deduplication groups findings but doesn't delete them. You can always see the full history.
</Note>

## Reporting

Export your findings for stakeholder communication and compliance documentation. Generate professional pentest reports, export to various formats, or integrate with your existing workflows.
