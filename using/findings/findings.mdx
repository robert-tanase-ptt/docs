---

Findings are security vulnerabilities and issues discovered during scans. The findings list is your central hub for reviewing, triaging, and managing all discovered issues across your assets.

## Viewing findings

Each finding in the list displays:

| Column | Description |
|--------|-------------|
| **Severity** | Risk level (Critical, High, Medium, Low, Info) |
| **Title** | Brief description of the vulnerability |
| **Asset** | Where the finding was discovered |
| **Status** | Current triage status |
| **Tool** | Scanner that detected the issue |
| **Date** | When it was discovered |

### Filtering and sorting

Use filters to focus on what matters:

- **By severity** — View only Critical and High findings, exclude informational items
- **By status** — Track remediation progress (New, Confirmed, Fixed, etc.)
- **By asset or tool** — Scope to specific targets or scanner types

<Tip>
Start your triage by filtering for Critical and High severity findings—these represent the greatest risk to your organization.
</Tip>

## Finding details

Select any finding to view comprehensive information:

- **Description** — What the vulnerability is and why it's a security concern
- **Evidence** — Proof of the vulnerability (request/response data, screenshots, payloads)
- **Remediation** — Step-by-step guidance on how to fix the issue
- **References** — Links to CVE entries, CWE classifications, OWASP documentation

## Actions

### Change status

Update the finding's lifecycle status:

| Status | Description | When to use |
|--------|-------------|-------------|
| **New** | Recently discovered | Not yet reviewed |
| **Confirmed** | Validated as real | Plan remediation |
| **In Progress** | Remediation underway | Track active work |
| **Fixed** | Remediated and verified | Close out |
| **Accepted** | Risk acknowledged | No action planned—document rationale |
| **False Positive** | Not a real vulnerability | Incorrect detection |

<Warning>
Document all risk acceptance decisions with clear rationale and approval from appropriate stakeholders.
</Warning>

### Change risk level

Adjust the severity rating if the automated assessment doesn't match the actual risk in your environment. Consider factors like:

- Business context and asset criticality
- Compensating controls in place
- Actual exploitability in your environment

### Add notes and comments

Document your findings with:

- Validation details and reproduction steps
- Remediation notes and progress updates
- Team communication and handoff information

### Rescan to verify fixes

<Steps>
  <Step title="Apply the fix">
    Implement the recommended remediation.
  </Step>
  <Step title="Rescan the target">
    Run a targeted scan to verify the fix worked.
  </Step>
  <Step title="Update status">
    Mark as Fixed if remediation is successful.
  </Step>
</Steps>

### Bulk operations

Select multiple findings to:

- Update status in batch
- Export selected items
- Assign to team members

## Add manual findings

<Info>
Manual findings are available on the **Pentest Suite** plan. [View plans](/plans-and-limits/plan-overview)
</Info>

Create findings manually for vulnerabilities discovered through manual testing that automated scanners can't detect. Use [finding templates](/using/findings/templates) to standardize documentation and save time.

## Deduplication

When running multiple scans, the same vulnerability may be detected more than once. Findings are automatically grouped as duplicates when they match on:

- Vulnerability type
- Location (same asset and URL/endpoint)
- Affected parameter

<Note>
Deduplication groups findings but doesn't delete them—you can always see the full history.
</Note>

## Suppression

Hide findings you don't want in your regular views:

- **Known issues** you're tracking elsewhere
- **Accepted risks** you've consciously decided to accept
- **False positives** you want to hide from default views

<Warning>
Be cautious with broad suppression rules—they may hide legitimate findings. Review suppression rules quarterly.
</Warning>

## Reporting

Export your findings for stakeholder communication and compliance documentation. Generate professional pentest reports, export to various formats, or integrate with your existing workflows.
