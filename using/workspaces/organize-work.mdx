<Info>
Workspaces are available on all paid plans. Accounts with the Free Edition have access to a single default workspace only.
</Info>

Workspaces are organizational containers that group related assets, targets, scans, findings, and attack surface data. Each workspace provides a separate context for your security testing activities.

When you create an account, a default workspace called **My Workspace** is automatically created. On paid plans, you can create additional workspaces and share them with team members.

## What workspaces contain

Each workspace includes:

| Item | Description |
|------|-------------|
| Assets and targets | The targets you add for security testing |
| Scans | All scan history for this workspace |
| Scheduled scans | Recurring scans configured for workspace targets |
| Findings | Vulnerabilities discovered in workspace scans |
| Attack surface data | Technology fingerprints and discovered hosts |
| Notification settings | Workspace-specific alert configurations |
| Handlers | XSS and HTTP handlers scoped to the workspace |

<Note>
Each workspace can optionally have a VPN profile assigned, allowing all scans within that workspace to route through your internal network. Learn more about [VPN profiles](/using/vpn/overview).
</Note>

## Creating a workspace

1. Click the workspace dropdown at the top of the sidebar
2. Select **Create workspace**
3. Enter a name and optional description
4. Click **Create**

## Switching workspaces

1. Click the workspace dropdown at the top of the sidebar
2. Select the workspace you want to switch to
3. The interface updates to show that workspace's assets, scans, and findings

## Organization strategies

<Tabs>
  <Tab title="By Client">
    **Best for**: Consulting firms and MSPs

    Create one workspace per client to keep their data separate.
  </Tab>
  <Tab title="By Project">
    **Best for**: Internal security teams

    Create workspaces for specific initiatives like "Q4 Assessment" or "New Product Launch".
  </Tab>
  <Tab title="By Environment">
    **Best for**: DevSecOps teams

    Separate workspaces for Development, Staging, and Production environments.
  </Tab>
</Tabs>

## Sharing workspaces

Share workspaces with subusers (colleagues) on your account. When sharing, you grant one of the following access levels:

| Access level | What they can do |
|--------------|------------------|
| **No access** | Cannot view or interact with the workspace |
| **View** | See assets, scans, and findings. Cannot start scans or modify anything. |
| **Edit** | Full access to start scans, manage assets, and work with findings. Cannot delete the workspace. |

### How sharing works

1. The workspace owner shares a workspace with selected team members
2. Team members see the shared workspace in their workspace list
3. Team members can switch to the shared workspace and work according to their permissions
4. Scans started by team members appear in the shared workspace, visible to all members with access

<Tip>
Use workspace sharing to collaborate on client engagements. Share a client workspace with your team so everyone can see findings and contribute to the assessment.
</Tip>

### For workspace owners

- Share workspaces from the workspace page or from **Settings → Team → Sharing**
- Choose which workspaces to share and with which team members
- Set appropriate access levels for each team member
- Revoke access at any time by removing sharing permissions

### For team members

- Shared workspaces appear in your workspace dropdown
- Your access level determines what actions you can take
- Switch between your own workspaces and shared workspaces freely
- Scans you start in a shared workspace are visible to all members with access

## Deleting a workspace

When deleting a workspace, you choose what happens to its contents:

- **Move assets** – Transfer all assets and their data to your default workspace
- **Delete everything** – Permanently remove all assets, scans, and findings

<Warning>
Deleting a workspace cannot be undone. If you choose to delete everything, all associated scan history and findings are permanently removed.
</Warning>

## Best practices

<AccordionGroup>
  <Accordion title="Use descriptive names">
    Name workspaces clearly so you and your team can quickly identify them. Include client names, project codes, or environment indicators.
  </Accordion>
  <Accordion title="Set up workspace notifications">
    Configure notification settings per workspace to get alerts relevant to each project. This prevents notification overload from unrelated scans.
  </Accordion>
  <Accordion title="Assign VPN profiles strategically">
    If scanning internal networks, assign the appropriate VPN profile to the workspace so all team members automatically use the correct network path.
  </Accordion>
  <Accordion title="Review sharing access regularly">
    Periodically audit who has access to which workspaces and what access levels they have, especially after team changes or project completions.
  </Accordion>
