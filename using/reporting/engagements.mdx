## What are engagements?

Engagements represent client projects or contracts in the platform. They store client and contract details that get included in your pentest reports, making it easy to generate professional deliverables with accurate project information.

Engagements can be shared with team members, allowing your entire team to use consistent client details in reports. See [Sharing engagements](#sharing-engagements) for details.

<Info>
When generating an **Editable pentest report**, you select both an Engagement (for client details) and a [Report Template](/using/reporting/report-templates) (for standard content sections).

## Engagement details

Each engagement includes the following fields:

| Field | Description |
|-------|-------------|
| **Name** | Engagement identifier (e.g., "Acme Corp - Q1 2024 Pentest") |
| **Client Company** | Name of the client organization |
| **Contract Number** | Reference number for the engagement contract |
| **Contract Date** | Date the contract was signed |
| **Start Date** | When the engagement begins |
| **End Date** | When the engagement concludes |

## Sharing engagements

Engagements can be shared with team members (subusers) on your account. When you share engagements, team members can use them when generating reports.

### Permission levels

| Permission | What they can do |
|------------|------------------|
| **No access** | Cannot see or use your engagements |
| **View** | Can view and use engagements in reports, but cannot edit or delete |
| **Edit** | Full access to view, use, edit, and delete engagements |

### How to share engagements

1. Go to **Settings** → **Team**
2. Select the team members you want to configure sharing for
3. Click **Share**
4. Set the **Engagements** permission level
5. Click **Save**

Shared engagements appear alongside your owned engagements when generating reports.

<Tip>
Share client engagements with your team so everyone working on the project can generate reports with consistent client details.
