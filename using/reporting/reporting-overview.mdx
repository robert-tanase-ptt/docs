## Report types

The platform offers four report types, each designed for different audiences and purposes:

| Report Type | Description | Best For |
|-------------|-------------|----------|
| **Raw scan results** | Full output from a single scan with all technical details | Quick review of individual scan results |
| **Aggregated scan results** | Combined results from multiple scans | Consolidated view across targets |
| **Security testing report** | Curated findings with severity breakdown | Technical teams and remediation planning |
| **Editable pentest report** | Professional penetration testing deliverable with customizable sections | Client deliverables and formal assessments |

<Info>
The **Editable pentest report** requires selecting an [Engagement](/using/reporting/engagements) and a [Report Template](/using/reporting/report-templates) to populate client details and standard sections.

## Report contents

### Standard sections

| Section | Description |
|---------|-------------|
| Executive Summary | Overview of findings and risk level |
| Scope | What was tested |
| Methodology | How testing was conducted |
| Findings | Detailed vulnerability descriptions |
| Remediation | Recommendations for each finding |
| Appendices | Supporting data and evidence |

### Findings information

Each finding in a report includes:

- Title and description
- Severity and risk rating
- Affected assets and locations
- Evidence (screenshots, requests/responses)
- Remediation guidance
- References (CVE, CWE, etc.)

## Where to generate reports

You can generate reports from three locations in the platform:

| Location | How to access |
|----------|---------------|
| **Scan result page** | Open a finished scan and click **Generate report** |
| **Scans page** | Select one or more scans from the list and click **Generate report** |
| **Findings page** | Select findings and click **Generate report** in the action bar |

## Generating reports

<Steps>
  <Step title="Select scope">
    Choose which scans or findings to include. You can generate reports from:
    - A single vulnerability or reconnaissance scan
    - Multiple scans (vulnerability, reconnaissance, or mixed)
    - Selected findings across scans
  </Step>
  <Step title="Choose report type">
    Select the report type that matches your needs. For pentest reports, you'll also select an [Engagement](/using/reporting/engagements) and [Report Template](/using/reporting/report-templates).
  </Step>
  <Step title="Configure filters">
    Optionally filter findings by severity, status (fixed, ignored, accepted), or include additional context like finding history and tool configuration.
  </Step>
  <Step title="Select format and generate">
    Pick your output format and generate the report.
  </Step>
</Steps>

## Output formats

| Format | Use Case |
|--------|----------|
| **PDF** | Professional documents for sharing and archiving |
| **DOCX** | Editable reports for customization before delivery |
| **HTML** | Web-based viewing and email sharing |
| **XLSX** | Spreadsheet analysis with structured data |
| **CSV** | Data processing and integration with other tools |
| **JSON** | API integration and programmatic access |

<Note>
Not all formats are available for every report type. Discovery scan aggregations support only PDF and HTML.
