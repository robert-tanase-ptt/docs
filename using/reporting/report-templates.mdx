## What are report templates?

Report templates define the reusable text sections that appear in your pentest reports. They ensure consistency across deliverables and save time when generating reports for different clients or projects.

Templates can be shared with team members, allowing your entire team to use consistent report formatting. See [Sharing templates](#sharing-templates) for details.

<Info>
Report templates are used when generating **Editable pentest reports**. When you create a pentest report, you select a template and an [Engagement](/using/reporting/engagements) to populate the report with your standard content and client details.

## Template types

| Type | Description |
|------|-------------|
| **Default templates** | System-provided templates you can use as-is or as a starting point |
| **Custom templates** | Templates you create and own, tailored to your workflow |

## Template sections

Each report template contains the following editable sections:

| Section | Purpose |
|---------|---------|
| **Name** | Template identifier for selection when generating reports |
| **Background** | Context about the engagement or project |
| **Objectives** | Goals of the security assessment |
| **Executive Summary** | High-level overview for stakeholders |
| **Scope** | What was tested and any exclusions |
| **Approach** | How the testing was conducted |
| **Methodology** | Detailed testing methodology and standards followed |
| **Disclaimer** | Legal disclaimers and limitations |

<Tip>
Create templates for common engagement types, such as external penetration tests, web application assessments, API reviews, so you can quickly generate consistent reports.

## Using Templates in Reports

When generating a pentest report:

1. Select your scans or findings to include
2. Choose **Editable pentest report** as the report type
3. Select a **Report Template** to populate standard sections
4. Select an **[Engagement](/using/reporting/engagements)** to include client and contract details
5. Specify the report author
6. Generate the report in your preferred format

The template content merges with your scan findings and engagement details to produce a complete penetration testing deliverable.

## Sharing templates

Report templates can be shared with team members (subusers) on your account. When you share templates, team members can use them to generate reports with consistent formatting.

### Permission levels

| Permission | What they can do |
|------------|------------------|
| **No access** | Cannot see or use your templates |
| **View** | Can view and use templates to generate reports, but cannot edit or delete |
| **Edit** | Full access to view, use, edit, and delete templates |

### How to share templates

1. Go to **Settings** → **Team**
2. Select the team members you want to configure sharing for
3. Click **Share**
4. Set the **Report Templates** permission level
5. Click **Save**

Templates you share will appear in your team members' template list, allowing them to select your templates when generating pentest reports.

<Tip>
Share your polished templates with View permission so team members can use them without accidentally modifying the content.
</Tip>
