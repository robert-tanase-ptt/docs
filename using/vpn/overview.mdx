## Why VPN Profiles?

By default, Pentest-Tools.com scans targets over the public internet. VPN profiles enable you to scan internal networks, private infrastructure, and resources not exposed to the internet.

## How It Works

<Steps>
  <Step title="Deploy Agent">
    Install a VPN agent in your internal network.
  </Step>
  <Step title="Establish Connection">
    The agent creates a secure tunnel to the platform.
  </Step>
  <Step title="Run Scans">
    Scans route through the agent to reach internal targets.
  </Step>
  <Step title="View Results">
    Results appear in the platform like any other scan.
  </Step>
</Steps>

## Use Cases

| Scenario | Description |
|----------|-------------|
| Internal Applications | Scan intranet sites and internal tools |
| Development Environments | Test staging servers not exposed publicly |
| Corporate Networks | Assess internal infrastructure security |
| Cloud VPCs | Scan private cloud resources |
| Isolated Segments | Test network segments with no internet access |

## Security Considerations

<Warning>
VPN agents have network access to your internal systems. Deploy them thoughtfully and restrict their network access appropriately.
</Warning>

- Agents only communicate outbound to Pentest-Tools.com
- No inbound ports need to be opened
- Traffic is encrypted
- Agent access can be restricted via firewall rules

## Requirements

- **Network**: Outbound internet access from the agent
- **Resources**: Minimal CPU and memory (varies by deployment)
- **Permissions**: Ability to deploy the chosen agent type
