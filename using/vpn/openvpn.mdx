## Overview

If you already have an OpenVPN server in your internal network, you can configure Pentest-Tools.com to use it instead of deploying a VPN agent.

<Info>
VPN profiles require the **Internal network scanning** add-on.
</Info>

## When to Use Custom OpenVPN

Use this option when:
- You already have an OpenVPN server deployed
- You want to use your existing VPN infrastructure
- Corporate policy requires using your own VPN

For most users, we recommend using the [VPN Agent](/using/vpn/virtual-machine) instead for easier setup.

## Prerequisites

- An existing OpenVPN server accessible from the internet
- OpenVPN configuration file (.ovpn)
- Optional: Username and password if your server requires authentication

## Setup process

<Steps>
  <Step title="Create VPN profile">
    In Pentest-Tools.com, go to Settings → VPN Profiles → Create.
  </Step>
  <Step title="Select Custom OpenVPN">
    Choose "Custom OpenVPN Server" as the type.
  </Step>
  <Step title="Upload configuration">
    Upload your .ovpn configuration file.
  </Step>
  <Step title="Add credentials">
    If required, enter your OpenVPN username and password.
  </Step>
  <Step title="Configure settings">
    Set DNS servers and other options.
  </Step>
</Steps>

## Configuration file requirements

Your .ovpn configuration file should contain:
- Server endpoint (IP or hostname)
- Port and protocol
- Certificates and keys (inline or referenced)
- Encryption settings

<Warning>
The OpenVPN configuration will be stored securely. Credentials are encrypted at rest.
</Warning>

## OpenVPN Server Requirements

Your OpenVPN server must:

- Be reachable from the internet (or from our platform)
- Allow connections from Pentest-Tools.com infrastructure
- Route traffic to your internal network

### Recommended server configuration

```conf
# Server config snippet
port 1194
proto udp
dev tun

# Enable client routing to internal networks
push "route 10.0.0.0 255.0.0.0"
push "route 192.168.0.0 255.255.0.0"
```

## Testing the Connection

After configuration, use Test connection to verify your OpenVPN server is reachable:

1. Go to **Settings → VPN Profiles**
2. Click on your profile name to open the details panel
3. Click **Test connection**
4. The platform will attempt to connect to your OpenVPN server
5. Status will show as **Success** if successful

<Tip>
After the test, check the **Connection logs** section in the profile details for detailed output. This is especially helpful when troubleshooting failed connections.
</Tip>

<Note>
Unlike VPN Agent profiles, Custom OpenVPN profiles do not show Online/Offline status. The platform connects to your OpenVPN server on-demand when running scans. Use **Test connection** to verify your configuration works correctly.
</Note>
