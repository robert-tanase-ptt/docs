## Scan Limits

Scan limits vary by subscription plan and help ensure fair platform usage and optimal performance.

## Limit Types

| Limit Type | Description |
|------------|-------------|
| **Concurrent Scans** | Maximum scans running simultaneously |
| **Monthly Scans** | Total scans allowed per billing period |
| **Scan Duration** | Maximum time a single scan can run |
| **Target Size** | Limits on target scope (IPs, URLs, etc.) |

## Understanding Your Limits

<Note>
Check your current usage and limits in your account dashboard under Usage & Limits.
</Note>

### What Happens at Limits?

- **Concurrent limit reached**: New scans queue until slots are available
- **Monthly limit reached**: Scans blocked until next billing period
- **Duration limit reached**: Scan stops with partial results

## Scan Behavior

### Queue Processing

Scans are processed in order:

1. Scan submitted → Added to queue
2. Resources available → Scan starts
3. Scan completes → Results available

### Resource Allocation

<AccordionGroup>
  <Accordion title="Scan Priority">
    All scans within your account are processed with equal priority.
  </Accordion>
  <Accordion title="Fair Usage">
    The platform balances resources across all users to ensure consistent performance.
  </Accordion>
  <Accordion title="Peak Times">
    During high-demand periods, queue times may be longer.
  </Accordion>
</AccordionGroup>

## Optimizing Scan Usage

<Tip>
Use light scans for reconnaissance and save deep scans for thorough assessments of critical assets.
</Tip>

### Efficiency Tips

- **Scope appropriately**: Don't scan broader than necessary
- **Use scheduling**: Spread scans across off-peak times
- **Review before running**: Verify configuration to avoid wasted scans
- **Combine when possible**: Some tools can test multiple targets efficiently

## Handling Long Scans

For large or complex targets:

| Challenge | Solution |
|-----------|----------|
| Scan timeout | Break into smaller scopes |
| Slow progress | Use lighter scan depth |
| Incomplete results | Review partial results, continue manually |

## Plan-Specific Limits

Different plans have different limits:

| Plan | Concurrent Scans | Monthly Scans |
|------|------------------|---------------|
| Free | 1 | Limited |
| Professional | Multiple | Higher |
| Enterprise | Maximum | Highest |
