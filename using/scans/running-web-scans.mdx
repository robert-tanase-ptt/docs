## Web Application Scanning

Web scans identify vulnerabilities in your web applications, including SQL injection, XSS, misconfigurations, and more.

## Available Web Scanners

<CardGroup cols={2}>
  <Card title="Website Vulnerability Scanner" icon="globe" href="/tools/website-vulnerability-scanner">
    Comprehensive web application security testing.
  </Card>
  <Card title="API Scanner" icon="plug" href="/tools/api-scanner">
    Test REST and GraphQL APIs for security issues.

  </Step>
  <Step title="Configure Options">
    Set scan depth, authentication, and any exclusions.
  </Step>
  <Step title="Launch Scan">
    Start the scan and monitor progress.
  </Step>

## Scan Configuration Options

### Scan Depth

| Depth | Coverage | Speed | Use Case |
|-------|----------|-------|----------|
| Light | Surface-level checks | Fast | Quick reconnaissance |
| Normal | Standard vulnerability checks | Moderate | Regular assessments |
| Deep | Comprehensive testing | Slow | Thorough security audits |

### Authentication

For testing authenticated areas:
- Cookie-based authentication
- Form-based login
- Header-based tokens

<Note>
Authenticated scanning discovers significantly more vulnerabilities by testing areas only accessible to logged-in users.
</Note>

## Best Practices

<AccordionGroup>
  <Accordion title="Start with Light Scans">
    Use light scans first to identify obvious issues quickly, then follow up with deeper scans.
  </Accordion>
  <Accordion title="Test in Staging First">
    When possible, test against staging environments before production.
  </Accordion>
  <Accordion title="Schedule Off-Peak">
    Run intensive scans during off-peak hours to minimize impact.
  </Accordion>
</AccordionGroup>
