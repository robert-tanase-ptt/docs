## Network Security Scanning

Network scans help you identify vulnerabilities in your infrastructure, including open ports, outdated services, misconfigurations, and known CVEs.

## Running Your First Network Scan

<Steps>
  <Step title="Add Network Assets">
    Add IP addresses or network ranges to your asset inventory.
  </Step>
  <Step title="Verify Authorization">
    Confirm you have permission to scan the target networks.
  </Step>
  <Step title="Select Scanner">
    Choose the appropriate network scanning tool.
  </Step>
  <Step title="Configure Scan">
    Set port ranges, scan intensity, and other options.
  </Step>
  <Step title="Launch and Monitor">
    Start the scan and track progress.
  </Step>
</Steps>

## Scan Configuration Options

### Port Ranges

| Option | Ports | Use Case |
|--------|-------|----------|
| Top 100 | Most common ports | Quick discovery |
| Top 1000 | Extended common ports | Standard assessment |
| Full | All 65,535 ports | Comprehensive audit |
| Custom | User-defined | Specific requirements |

### Scan Intensity

<Warning>
Higher intensity scans are more thorough but may trigger security alerts or impact network performance.
</Warning>

- **Stealth**: Slower, less likely to be detected
- **Normal**: Balanced speed and coverage
- **Aggressive**: Faster, more comprehensive

## Internal Network Scanning

To scan internal networks, you'll need to set up a VPN profile:

## Best Practices

<Tip>
Start with port discovery to understand what's exposed, then run vulnerability scans against discovered services.
</Tip>

- Coordinate with network teams before scanning
- Start with less intensive scans
- Document all scanning activities
- Review and triage findings promptly
