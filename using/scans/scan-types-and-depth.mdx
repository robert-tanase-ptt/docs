description: "Understand Light, Deep, and Custom scan types and when to use each"
---

Most scanning tools offer three scan types that balance speed, thoroughness, and customization.

## Light

Light scans are fast, surface-level assessments designed for quick results with minimal impact on the target.

| Aspect | Details |
|--------|---------|
| **Speed** | Fast, typically completes in seconds to minutes |
| **Coverage** | Common ports only (typically top 100) for network tools; shallow crawling and fewer checks for web tools |
| **Detection** | Version-based detection, compares service versions against known vulnerability databases |
| **Impact** | Low traffic, less likely to trigger IDS/IPS alerts |

### When to use Light scans

- Quick reconnaissance of a new target
- Initial health checks before deeper testing
- Time-sensitive assessments
- Testing scan configurations before committing to a full scan
- Targets where you want to minimize traffic

<Note>
Light scans rely primarily on service version fingerprinting, which can produce **false positives** if services report inaccurate versions. Always validate critical findings.
</Note>

## Deep

Deep scans perform full assessments with extended coverage and additional detection capabilities.

| Aspect | Details |
|--------|---------|
| **Speed** | Slower, can take minutes to hours depending on target |
| **Coverage** | Extended port ranges for network tools; deeper spidering and more tests for web tools |
| **Detection** | Multiple engines including version-based, Sniper, Nuclei, active vulnerability checks, and full enumeration |
| **Impact** | Higher traffic volume, may be detected by security monitoring |

### When to use Deep scans

- Full security audits and assessments
- Compliance requirements
- Pre-release security testing
- Annual security reviews
- When you need full coverage

<Note>
Deep scans generate more network traffic and may create noise in target logs. Coordinate with system owners when scanning production environments.
</Note>

## Custom

Custom scans give you full control over scan parameters, including tests, engines, and detection options.

| Aspect | Details |
|--------|---------|
| **Speed** | Varies based on configuration |
| **Coverage** | User-defined scope (ports for network tools, spidering settings for web tools) |
| **Detection** | User-selected tests and engines |
| **Impact** | Depends on configuration choices |

### When to use Custom scans

- Targeting specific ports or services
- Focusing on particular vulnerability types
- Fine-tuning scan behavior for specific environments
- Advanced users who understand the trade-offs

### Custom options

Depending on the tool, Custom mode may let you configure:

- **Scanning engines**: Select which detection engines or tests to run
- **Port selection**: Specify exact ports, ranges, or predefined lists (network tools)
- **Protocol**: TCP or UDP scanning (network tools)
- **Spidering settings**: Configure crawl depth, approach, and time limits (web tools)
- **URL inclusions/exclusions**: Control which paths to scan or skip (web tools)
- **Authentication**: Configure credentials for protected areas (web tools)
- **Rate limiting**: Control requests per second to reduce impact

<Info>
Custom scan options vary by tool. Check the specific tool's documentation for available parameters.

## Comparison summary

| | Light | Deep | Custom |
|---|-------|------|--------|
| **Speed** | Fast | Slow | Varies |
| **Coverage** | Basic | Full | User-defined |
| **False positives** | More likely | Less likely | Depends on config |
| **Target impact** | Low | High | User-controlled |
| **Best for** | Quick checks | Full audits | Specific needs |

<Tip>
Start with a Light scan to get a quick read on the target, then follow up with Deep or Custom scans on areas of concern.
