Most scanning tools offer three scan types that balance speed, thoroughness, and customization.

## Light

Light scans are fast, surface-level assessments designed for quick results with minimal impact on the target.

| Aspect | Details |
|--------|---------|
| **Speed** | Fast—typically completes in seconds to minutes |
| **Coverage** | Scans common ports only (typically top 100) |
| **Detection** | Version-based detection—compares service versions against known vulnerability databases |
| **Impact** | Low traffic, less likely to trigger IDS/IPS alerts |

### When to use Light scans

- Quick reconnaissance of a new target
- Initial health checks before deeper testing
- Time-sensitive assessments
- Testing scan configurations before committing to a full scan
- Targets where you want to minimize traffic

<Warning>
Light scans rely primarily on service version fingerprinting, which can produce **false positives** if services report inaccurate versions. Always validate critical findings.
</Warning>

## Deep

Deep scans perform comprehensive assessments using multiple detection engines and extended port ranges.

| Aspect | Details |
|--------|---------|
| **Speed** | Slower—can take minutes to hours depending on target |
| **Coverage** | Extended port ranges (typically top 1,000–5,000 ports) |
| **Detection** | Multiple engines including version-based, Sniper, Nuclei, and active vulnerability checks |
| **Impact** | Higher traffic volume, may be detected by security monitoring |

### When to use Deep scans

- Full security audits and assessments
- Compliance requirements
- Pre-release security testing
- Annual security reviews
- When you need comprehensive coverage

<Note>
Deep scans generate more network traffic and may create noise in target logs. Coordinate with system owners when scanning production environments.
</Note>

## Custom

Custom scans give you full control over scan parameters—engines, ports, and detection options.

| Aspect | Details |
|--------|---------|
| **Speed** | Varies based on configuration |
| **Coverage** | User-defined ports (specific list, range, or preset) |
| **Detection** | User-selected engines and options |
| **Impact** | Depends on configuration choices |

### When to use Custom scans

- Targeting specific ports or services
- Focusing on particular vulnerability types
- Fine-tuning scan behavior for specific environments
- Advanced users who understand the trade-offs

### Custom options

Depending on the tool, Custom mode may let you configure:

- **Scanning engines** — Select which detection engines to run
- **Port selection** — Specify exact ports, ranges, or predefined lists
- **Protocol** — TCP or UDP scanning
- **Rate limiting** — Control requests per second to reduce impact

<Info>
Custom scan options vary by tool. Check the specific tool's documentation for available parameters.

## Comparison summary

| | Light | Deep | Custom |
|---|-------|------|--------|
| **Speed** | Fast | Slow | Varies |
| **Coverage** | Basic | Comprehensive | User-defined |
| **False positives** | More likely | Less likely | Depends on config |
| **Target impact** | Low | High | User-controlled |
| **Best for** | Quick checks | Full audits | Specific needs |

<Tip>
Start with a Light scan to understand the target landscape, then follow up with Deep or Custom scans on areas of concern.
