---

Scheduled scans automate your security testing by running scans at specified intervals, helping you maintain continuous security visibility without manual intervention.

## What can you schedule?

You can schedule two types of scans:

- **Individual tools** — Schedule any [security tool](/tools) to run automatically (e.g., Network Scanner, Website Scanner, Port Scanner)
- **Pentest Robots** — Schedule [Pentest Robots](/automation/robots/what-are-pentest-robots) to run automated, multi-tool assessments on a recurring basis

## Creating a scheduled scan

<Steps>
  <Step title="Configure your scan">
    Set up your scan with the desired tool, target, and options (scan type, authentication, etc.).
  </Step>
  <Step title="Enable scheduling">
    Click the **Schedule** button instead of **Start scan**.
  </Step>
  <Step title="Set start date and time">
    Choose when the first scan should run. The time uses your account's time zone.
  </Step>
  <Step title="Set frequency">
    Choose how often the scan should repeat.
  </Step>
  <Step title="Configure compliance (optional)">
    Enable **Send to Vanta** if you want scan results sent to Vanta for compliance reporting.
  </Step>
</Steps>

## Schedule frequencies

The available frequencies depend on your subscription plan.

| Frequency | Description | Free Plan | Paid Plans |
|-----------|-------------|-----------|------------|
| **No repeat** | Run once at the scheduled time | — | ✓ |
| **Daily** | Run every day | — | ✓ |
| **Weekly** | Run every week | ✓ | ✓ |
| **Monthly** | Run every month | ✓ | ✓ |
| **Quarterly** | Run every 3 months | — | ✓ |
| **Yearly** | Run every year | — | ✓ |

<Info>
Free plan users can schedule scans with **Weekly** or **Monthly** frequencies. [Upgrade your plan](/plans-and-limits/plan-overview) to access all scheduling options.
</Info>

<Note>
If you schedule a Monthly or Quarterly scan starting on the last day of a month (e.g., January 31), it will automatically run on the last day of each subsequent month (e.g., February 28/29, March 31).
</Note>

## Vanta compliance integration

When scheduling a scan, you can optionally send the results to [Vanta](/notifications/security/vanta) for automated compliance monitoring and evidence collection.

**To enable Vanta integration:**
1. First, [configure the Vanta integration](/notifications/security/vanta) in your account settings
2. When scheduling a scan, toggle **Send to Vanta** to **On**

<Warning>
If Vanta is not configured, the "Send to Vanta" toggle will be disabled. You'll need to set up the integration first.
</Warning>

**Benefits of sending to Vanta:**
- Automated compliance evidence collection
- Continuous security posture monitoring
- Audit-ready vulnerability reports
- Support for SOC 2, ISO 27001, HIPAA, and other frameworks

## Managing scheduled scans

Access all your scheduled scans from the **Scheduled Scans** dashboard.

### Viewing scheduled scans

The dashboard shows:
- All scheduled scans and their status (enabled/disabled)
- Next scheduled run time
- Frequency settings
- Target and tool information
- Last execution results

### Actions

| Action | Description |
|--------|-------------|
| **Enable/Disable** | Toggle a scheduled scan on or off without deleting it |
| **Run now** | Trigger an immediate execution of the scheduled scan |
| **Edit** | Modify the schedule settings (frequency, start time, Vanta toggle) |
| **Delete** | Permanently remove the scheduled scan |

<Tip>
Use **Disable** instead of **Delete** if you want to temporarily pause a scheduled scan. This preserves your configuration for when you're ready to resume.
</Tip>

## Notifications

Scheduled scans work seamlessly with the [notifications system](/notifications/overview). Configure alerts to stay informed about your automated scans:

| Notification | When it triggers |
|--------------|------------------|
| **Scan started** | When a scheduled scan begins execution |
| **Scan completed** | When a scheduled scan finishes (with results summary) |
| **New findings** | When new vulnerabilities are discovered |
| **Scan failed** | When a scheduled scan encounters an error |

<Tip>
Set up notifications for scheduled scans to ensure you're alerted to new findings even when you're not actively monitoring.
</Tip>

## Timing considerations

- **Time zone**: Schedules use your account's time zone setting
- **Start time**: The exact time when the scan should begin
- **Duration**: Some scans may run longer than expected—plan accordingly if scheduling multiple scans

<Tip>
Schedule intensive scans during off-peak hours to minimize impact on production systems and users.
</Tip>

## Best practices

<AccordionGroup>
  <Accordion title="Start conservative">
    Begin with weekly scans and adjust the frequency based on how often your assets change. Critical or frequently updated assets may benefit from daily scans.
  </Accordion>
  <Accordion title="Stagger schedules">
    Don't schedule all scans at the same time. Spread them throughout the day or week to avoid resource contention and ensure each scan gets adequate attention.
  </Accordion>
  <Accordion title="Review results regularly">
    Scheduled scans are only valuable if you act on the findings. Set up notifications and establish a regular review cadence.
  </Accordion>
  <Accordion title="Use Vanta for compliance">
    If you need to demonstrate regular security testing for compliance purposes, enable the Vanta integration to automatically collect evidence.
  </Accordion>
  <Accordion title="Monitor scan health">
    Periodically check that your scheduled scans are completing successfully. Failed scans may indicate connectivity issues, expired credentials, or target changes.
