## What Is Attack Surface Management?

Attack Surface Management (ASM) is the continuous process of discovering, cataloging, and monitoring your external-facing assets to understand and reduce security risks.

## The Attack Surface Dashboard

The Attack Surface view provides a comprehensive overview of your discovered assets:

## Key Features

### Asset Discovery

Automatically discover assets you may not know about:

- **Subdomains**: Find all subdomains of your domains
- **IP Addresses**: Discover associated IP addresses
- **Services**: Identify running services and open ports
- **Certificates**: Track SSL/TLS certificates

### Risk Assessment

Each discovered asset is assessed for risk based on:

| Factor | Description |
|--------|-------------|
| Exposure | How accessible is the asset from the internet? |
| Technology | Are there known vulnerabilities in detected software? |
| Configuration | Are there misconfigurations or weak settings? |
| Age | Is the asset using outdated software? |

### Continuous Monitoring

<Note>
Attack surfaces change constantly. New assets are deployed, configurations change, and new vulnerabilities are discovered. Continuous monitoring helps you stay aware.
</Note>

## Getting Started

<Steps>
  <Step title="Add Root Assets">
    Start by adding your primary domains to the platform.
  </Step>
  <Step title="Run Discovery">
    Launch discovery scans to find related assets.
  </Step>
  <Step title="Review Results">
    Analyze discovered assets and their risk levels.
  </Step>
  <Step title="Take Action">
    Address high-risk items and add assets to your inventory.
  </Step>
</Steps>

## Best Practices

<Tip>
Run discovery scans regularly—monthly at minimum—to catch newly deployed assets and changes.
