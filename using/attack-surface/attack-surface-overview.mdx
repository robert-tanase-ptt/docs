## What is attack surface management?

Attack Surface Management (ASM) is the continuous process of discovering, cataloging, and monitoring your external-facing assets to understand and reduce security risks.

<Info>
All attack surface data lives inside your current workspace. Every IP, hostname, port, URL, and technology entry keeps a link back to the scan and tool that produced it, so you can jump directly to the originating results.
</Info>

## The attack surface dashboard

The Attack Surface view provides a comprehensive overview of your discovered assets:

<CardGroup cols={2}>
  <Card title="Asset Discovery" icon="magnifying-glass">
    Automatically find subdomains, IPs, and services.
  </Card>
  <Card title="Technology Stack" icon="layer-group">
    Identify technologies running on your assets.
  </Card>
  <Card title="Risk Indicators" icon="gauge">
    See which assets pose the greatest risk.
  </Card>
  <Card title="Change Tracking" icon="clock-rotate-left">
    Monitor changes to your attack surface over time.
  </Card>
</CardGroup>

## How data gets into the attack surface

We automatically populate the Attack Surface View (ASV) from supported scanners:

- **Port Scanner (TCP or UDP)**: Adds open ports and service fingerprints per target.
- **Network Scanner**: Adds ports, protocols, services, and discovered technologies.
- **Website Scanner** and **Website Recon**: Add URLs, titles, technologies, and screenshots where available.

New discoveries are merged into your workspace inventory: new ports and URLs are appended; existing ones are refreshed instead of wiping other scan results.

<Note>
If a scan finds an additional port, ASV adds that port to the existing IP/host entry. Other ports and technologies stay intact.
</Note>

## Grouping and Navigation

Use **Group by** to organize results the way you work:

- IP Address (single, all-in-one list)
- Hostname
- Port
- Protocol
- Service
- Technology

Switching the grouping changes only the view; the underlying data remains the same. You can drill into an item to open the scan that created it.

## Exports

You can export the current attack surface at any time:

- **CSV**: Full data (IPs, hosts, ports, protocols, services, URLs, technologies)
- **CSV (Network Only)**: Network-layer fields only (no URLs/technologies)
- **JSON**: Structured export of the full dataset

Exports respect your current grouping, so you can keep the structure you see in the UI.

## Key features

### Asset discovery

Automatically discover assets you may not know about:

- **Subdomains**: Find all subdomains of your domains
- **IP Addresses**: Discover associated IP addresses
- **Services**: Identify running services and open ports
- **Certificates**: Track SSL/TLS certificates

### Continuous monitoring

<Note>
Attack surfaces change constantly. New assets are deployed, configurations change, and new vulnerabilities are discovered. Continuous monitoring helps you stay aware.
</Note>

## Getting started

<Steps>
  <Step title="Add Root Assets">
    Start by adding your primary domains to the platform.
  </Step>
  <Step title="Run Discovery">
    Launch reconnaissance scans to find related assets.
  </Step>
  <Step title="Review Results">
    Analyze discovered assets and their risk levels.
  </Step>
  <Step title="Take Action">
    Address high-risk items and add assets to your inventory.
  </Step>
</Steps>

## Best practices

<Tip>
Run reconnaissance scans regularly (monthly at minimum) to catch newly deployed assets and changes.
