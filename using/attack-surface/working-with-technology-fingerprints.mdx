## What Is Technology Fingerprinting?

Technology fingerprinting identifies the software, frameworks, and services running on your assets. This information helps you:

- Understand your technology stack
- Identify potentially vulnerable software
- Plan targeted security testing
- Track technology changes over time

## Understanding Fingerprint Data

Each fingerprint includes:

| Field | Description |
|-------|-------------|
| **Technology** | Name of the detected software |
| **Version** | Detected version (when available) |
| **Category** | Type of technology |
| **Confidence** | How certain the detection is |
| **Asset** | Where it was detected |

## Using Fingerprints for Security

### Vulnerability Correlation

When versions are detected, you can:

1. Check for known CVEs
2. Identify outdated software
3. Prioritize updates

<Warning>
Detected versions may be inaccurate if applications hide or modify version banners.
</Warning>

### Targeted Testing

Use fingerprint data to select appropriate scanners:

| Technology Detected | Recommended Scanner |
|--------------------|---------------------|
| WordPress | WordPress Scanner |
| Drupal | Drupal Scanner |
| Custom Application | Website Vulnerability Scanner |
| SSL/TLS | SSL/TLS Scanner |

## Filtering and Searching

Find specific technologies across your assets:

- **By Technology**: Find all assets running a specific software
- **By Version**: Identify assets with specific versions
- **By Category**: Filter by technology type
- **By Risk**: Focus on technologies with known issues

## Tracking Changes

Monitor technology changes over time:

- New technologies deployed
- Version updates (or lack thereof)
- Removed technologies
- Configuration changes

<Tip>
Set up alerts for technology changes, especially in production environments.
