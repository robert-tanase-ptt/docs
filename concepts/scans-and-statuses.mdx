## Scan lifecycle

Every scan moves through a predictable sequence from creation to results.

<Steps>
<Step title="Waiting">
  The platform accepted the scan and placed it in the queue. We hold it here until workers are available and any required VPN/agent is ready.
</Step>
<Step title="Running">
  The scanner is actively probing the target. You can pause or stop from the UI while in this state.
</Step>
<Step title="Wrap-up & results">
  Once the scanner finishes, we compile findings and metadata, then mark the scan as finished or the appropriate terminal status.
</Step>
</Steps>

<Tip>
Schedule scans during off-peak hours to reduce queue time and keep throughput high.
</Tip>

## Scan statuses (runtime)

These labels map to the runtime `ScanStatus` enum used by the platform.

| Status label | What it means | Typical next step |
|--------------|---------------|-------------------|
| **Waiting** | Scan is queued and not yet executing | Keep the tab open; it should transition to Running automatically |
| **Running** | Scanner is actively working | Monitor progress or stop if needed |
| **Finished** | Scanner completed and results are ready | Review findings and download the report |
| **Stopped** | You or the system stopped the run | Rerun after adjusting scope or timing |
| **Timeout** | Scan exceeded the allowed duration | Narrow scope or increase timeout where supported |
| **Start Error** | Scan failed before it could start | Check target reachability and configuration, then retry |
| **Aborted** | Platform terminated the scan unexpectedly | Retry; contact support if it recurs |
| **VPN Error** | Required VPN connection could not be established | Verify VPN agent status and credentials |
| **Authentication Error** | Provided auth to the target failed | Update credentials or verification tokens |
| **Connection Error** | Network connection to target failed | Confirm DNS/ports/firewall and try again |
| **Skipped** | Run bypassed because a block/robot rule prevented execution | Adjust robot rules or allowlisting, then rerun |

## Status flow

```
Waiting → Running → Finished
                ↘ Stopped
                ↘ Timeout
                ↘ Start Error / Aborted / VPN Error / Authentication Error / Connection Error / Skipped
```

<Note>
Running and Waiting are the only active states. Everything else is terminal; Finished, Stopped, and Timeout retain partial or full results, while error states do not.
</Note>

## Understanding scan results

When a scan completes, you'll see:

- **Findings count**: Number of vulnerabilities discovered
- **Severity breakdown**: Distribution by severity level
- **Scan duration**: How long the scan took
- **Coverage**: What was tested

<Note>
A completed scan with zero findings doesn't mean the target is secure. It means the scanner didn't detect vulnerabilities with its current checks.
</Note>

## Common issues

<AccordionGroup>
  <Accordion title="Scan stuck in Waiting">
    This usually means workers are busy or the required VPN/agent is starting. If it persists, stop and rerun during off-peak hours.
  </Accordion>
  <Accordion title="Timeout">
    Large scopes can hit duration limits. Reduce target scope or split into smaller scans, then rerun.
  </Accordion>
  <Accordion title="Connection or Authentication Error">
    Confirm DNS resolution, ports, firewall rules, and supplied credentials or verification tokens.
  </Accordion>
  <Accordion title="VPN Error">
    Ensure the VPN agent is online and the tunnel profile is valid. Restart the agent if needed.
  </Accordion>
  <Accordion title="Stopped or Aborted">
    If you stopped it manually, rerun when ready. For Aborted, retry once; if repeated, contact support with the scan ID.
  </Accordion>
</AccordionGroup>
