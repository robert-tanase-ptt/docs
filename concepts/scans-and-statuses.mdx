## Scan Lifecycle

Every scan goes through a defined lifecycle from initiation to completion.

## Scan Statuses

| Status | Description |
|--------|-------------|
| **Queued** | Scan is waiting to be processed |
| **Running** | Scan is actively in progress |
| **Completed** | Scan finished successfully |
| **Failed** | Scan encountered an error |
| **Stopped** | Scan was manually stopped by user |
| **Paused** | Scan is temporarily paused |

## Status Flow

```
Queued → Running → Completed
                 → Failed
                 → Stopped
```

## Understanding Scan Results

When a scan completes, you'll see:

- **Findings count**: Number of vulnerabilities discovered
- **Severity breakdown**: Distribution by severity level
- **Scan duration**: How long the scan took
- **Coverage**: What was tested

<Note>
A completed scan with zero findings doesn't mean the target is secure—it means the scanner didn't detect vulnerabilities with its current checks.
</Note>

## Common Issues

<AccordionGroup>
  <Accordion title="Scan stuck in Queued">
    This may occur during high platform usage. Scans are processed in order.
  </Accordion>
  <Accordion title="Scan Failed">
    Check if the target is reachable and that your asset verification is still valid.
  </Accordion>
  <Accordion title="Incomplete Results">
    Some scans may timeout on large targets. Consider adjusting scan settings.
