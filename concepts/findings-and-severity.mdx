## What Are Findings?

Findings are security issues, vulnerabilities, or informational items discovered during scans. Each finding includes details about the issue, its location, and remediation guidance.

## Severity Levels

Pentest-Tools.com uses a standard severity scale to help you prioritize remediation:

| Severity | Description | Action |
|----------|-------------|--------|
| **Critical** | Severe vulnerabilities that could lead to full system compromise | Immediate remediation required |
| **High** | Significant vulnerabilities with serious impact potential | Remediate as soon as possible |
| **Medium** | Moderate risk vulnerabilities | Plan remediation in near term |
| **Low** | Minor issues with limited impact | Address when convenient |
| **Info** | Informational findings, not necessarily vulnerabilities | Review for awareness |
