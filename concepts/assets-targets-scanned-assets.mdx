## Understanding the Terminology

Pentest-Tools.com uses specific terms to describe what you're testing. Understanding these distinctions helps you work more effectively.

## Assets

An **asset** is a resource you've added to the platform that you're authorized to test. Assets can be:

- **Domains**: e.g., `example.com`
- **IP Addresses**: e.g., `192.168.1.1`
- **URLs**: e.g., `https://example.com/app`
- **Network Ranges**: e.g., `192.168.1.0/24`

<Note>
Assets must be verified before scanning to confirm you have authorization to test them.
</Note>

## Targets

A **target** is the specific item being scanned in a particular scan job. When you run a scan, you select one or more assets as targets for that scan.

## Scanned Assets

**Scanned assets** are assets that have been actively tested by at least one scan. They may have associated findings and scan history.

## Relationship Diagram

```
Asset (what you own/manage)
  └── Target (what you're scanning)
        └── Scanned Asset (has scan history & findings)
```

## Best Practices

<Tip>
Organize your assets logically—group by environment (production, staging), by client, or by application to make scanning and reporting more efficient.
