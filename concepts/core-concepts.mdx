## Platform architecture

Pentest-Tools.com is an integrated security testing platform. The components described below connect to form the workflow you use day-to-day.

## Core workflow

<Steps>
  <Step title="Define your assets">
    Add the targets you want to test, such as domains, IPs, URLs, or network ranges.
  </Step>
  <Step title="Run scans">
    Run scans using the appropriate tools for your targets.
  </Step>
  <Step title="Review findings">
    Analyze discovered vulnerabilities, triage them, and plan remediation.
  </Step>
  <Step title="Generate reports">
    Create professional reports for stakeholders and compliance requirements.
  </Step>
</Steps>

## Key components

### Workspaces

Workspaces help you organize assets and scans by project, client, or any other logical grouping.

**Learn more:**
- [Organize work with workspaces](/using/workspaces/organize-work)

### Assets & targets

Assets represent the systems you're authorized to test. They can be domains, IP addresses, URLs, or network ranges. Targets are the specific items being scanned in a particular scan job.

**Learn more:**
- [Assets](/using/assets/assets)
- [Assets and limits](/plans-and-limits/assets-and-limits)

### Tools

Tools are the scanners and utilities you use to test your assets. They are organized into categories such as reconnaissance, vulnerability scanning, exploitation, and more. Each tool category produces different output: not all tools generate findings or create scans.

- [Tools](/concepts/tools)
- [Tools reference](/tools/index)

### Scans

Scans are the actual security tests you run against your targets using the platform's tools.

**Learn more:**
- [Scan types and depth](/using/scans/scan-types-and-depth)
- [Authenticated scanning](/using/scans/authenticated-scanning)
- [Scheduled scans](/using/scans/scheduled-scans)
- [Scans and statuses](/concepts/scans-and-statuses)

### Findings

Findings are the vulnerabilities and security issues discovered during scans.

**Learn more:**
- [Findings overview](/using/findings/findings)
- [Finding templates](/using/findings/templates)

### Attack surface

Attack Surface Management (ASM) is the continuous process of discovering, cataloging, and monitoring your external-facing assets to understand and reduce security risks. The platform automatically populates your attack surface view from supported scanners.

- [Attack surface overview](/using/attack-surface/attack-surface-overview)

### Reports

Reports are generated from your findings and provide documentation for stakeholders and compliance requirements.

- [Report templates](/using/reporting/report-templates)
- [Engagements](/using/reporting/engagements)
- [Branded reports](/using/reporting/branded-reports)
