## Key components

### Workspaces

Workspaces help you organize assets and scans by project, client, or any other logical grouping.

**Learn more:**
- [Organize work with workspaces](/using/workspaces/organize-work)

### Assets & targets

Assets represent the systems you're authorized to test. They can be domains, IP addresses, URLs, or network ranges. Targets are the specific items being scanned in a particular scan job.

**Learn more:**
- [Assets](/using/assets/assets)
- [Assets and limits](/plans-and-limits/assets-and-limits)

### Scans

Scans are the actual security tests you run against your targets using the platform's tools.

**Learn more:**
- [Scan types and depth](/using/scans/scan-types-and-depth)
- [Authenticated scanning](/using/scans/authenticated-scanning)
- [Scheduled scans](/using/scans/scheduled-scans)
- [Scans and statuses](/concepts/scans-and-statuses)

### Findings

Findings are the vulnerabilities and security issues discovered during scans.

**Learn more:**
- [Findings overview](/using/findings/findings)
- [Finding templates](/using/findings/templates)

### Attack surface

Attack Surface Management (ASM) is the continuous process of discovering, cataloging, and monitoring your external-facing assets to understand and reduce security risks. The platform automatically populates your attack surface view from supported scanners.

### Reports

Professional reports generated from your findings for stakeholders and compliance requirements.

- [Report templates](/using/reporting/report-templates)
- [Engagements](/using/reporting/engagements)
