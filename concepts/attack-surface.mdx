## What Is Attack Surface?

Your **attack surface** is the sum of all points where an attacker could potentially gain unauthorized access to your systems. This includes:

- Exposed web applications
- Open network ports
- Public-facing APIs
- Subdomains and virtual hosts
- Cloud resources
- Third-party integrations

## Attack Surface Management

Attack surface management (ASM) is the continuous process of discovering, inventorying, and monitoring your external-facing assets.

## Why It Matters

<Warning>
Organizations often have 30-40% more external assets than they're aware of. Unknown assets can't be protected.

## Key Capabilities

- **Subdomain enumeration**: Discover all subdomains of your domains
- **Technology fingerprinting**: Identify what software is running
- **Port scanning**: Find open services
- **Certificate monitoring**: Track SSL/TLS certificates
