## What are pentest robots?

Pentest robots are automation workflows that run multiple security tools in sequence. Each robot defines a series of scans where output from one tool feeds into the next. You configure a target, start the robot, and it handles the rest.

Robots can be shared with team members. See [Sharing robots](#sharing-robots) for details.

## Default robots

The platform ships with pre-built robots available to all users:

| Robot | What it does |
|-------|-------------|
| **The HTTP Lockpicker** | Scans for web services, crawls for login interfaces, then brute-forces them |
| **Domain Recon** | Discovers subdomains, port scans them, and runs Website Recon on all HTTP/S ports. Populates the Attack Surface |
| **All Domains Recon** | Extended version of Domain Recon. Discovers company domains (filtered by certainty >= 80%), then runs the full subdomain/port/recon chain |
| **Log4Shell Detector (CVE-2021-44228)** | Discovers web apps, crawls pages and forms, and injects payloads to test for CVE-2021-44228 |
| **Treasure Hunter (domain)** | Finds subdomains, port scans each one, then runs URL Fuzzer on all HTTP/S ports to discover hidden files and directories |
| **Treasure Hunter (host)** | Port scans the target host (top 1000), then runs URL Fuzzer on each HTTP/S port |
| **Auto HTTP Login Bruteforcer** | Discovers password-protected URLs (HTTP 401) and brute-forces them with common credentials across all HTTP/S ports |
| **Website Scanner - All Ports** | Discovers all HTTP/S ports (1-65535), then runs Website Scanner on each |
| **Website Scanner - Top 1000 Ports** | Discovers HTTP/S ports (top 1000), then runs Website Scanner on each |
| **Deep WordPress Scan** | Runs Website Scanner first, then if WordPress is detected, runs the WordPress Scanner for CMS-specific vulnerabilities |
| **Network Scanner - Critical CVEs (domain)** | Discovers subdomains, identifies machines behind the domain, runs Sniper Detection Modules on each |
| **Network Scanner - Full (domain)** | Same as above, but runs Network Scanner with OpenVAS Full&Fast plus Sniper detection modules |

## Running a robot

<Steps>
  <Step title="Navigate to Robots">
    Go to **Automation > Robots** in the main navigation.
  </Step>
  <Step title="Select a robot">
    Click on a robot to view its description and workflow.
  </Step>
  <Step title="Start a new scan">
    Click **New scan** and select the target(s) you want to scan.
  </Step>
  <Step title="Configure and run">
    Review the configuration and start the robot.
  </Step>
</Steps>

## Scheduling robots

You can schedule robots to run at regular intervals:

<Steps>
  <Step title="Start a new scan">
    Click **New scan** on any robot.
  </Step>
  <Step title="Enable scheduling">
    Toggle the scheduling option and configure:
    - **Frequency**: how often the robot should run (once, daily, weekly, monthly, quarterly, yearly)
    - **Start date**: when to begin the schedule
  </Step>
  <Step title="Save schedule">
    The robot will run automatically at the configured intervals.
  </Step>
</Steps>

<Note>
Scheduled robot scans appear in your [Scheduled Scans](/using/scans/scheduled-scans) list where you can manage, pause, or cancel them.
</Note>

## Managing robots

### Viewing robot details

Click on any robot to see:
- Description of what the robot does
- The workflow and tools it uses
- Available actions (edit, delete) depending on your permissions

### Editing robots

For robots you own, you can update the name and description.

## Robot execution

When a robot runs, tools execute in the defined order. Output from one tool feeds into the next, and some robots include filters that control which results trigger subsequent steps. Findings from all tools are combined in the final results.

### Monitoring progress

During execution, you can see which step is currently running and track findings as they appear.

### Results

Robot scan results include combined findings from all tools in the workflow, individual tool outputs, and the execution timeline.

## Example use cases

| Goal | Robot to use |
|------|-------------|
| Map a new domain's exposure | Domain Recon or All Domains Recon |
| Find hidden files and sensitive data | Treasure Hunter (domain or host) |
| Regular web vulnerability checks | Schedule Website Scanner - Top 1000 Ports weekly |
| Test for a specific CVE | Log4Shell Detector |
| Full web + CMS assessment | Deep WordPress Scan (if WordPress) or Website Scanner - All Ports |

## Sharing robots

You can share robots with team members on your account. Shared robots appear alongside default robots, so team members can run them on their own targets.

### Permission levels

| Permission | What they can do |
|------------|------------------|
| **No access** | Cannot see or use your robots |
| **View** | Can view and run robots, but not edit or delete |
| **Edit** | Full access to view, run, edit, and delete robots |

### How to share robots

1. Go to **Team** in the sidebar
2. Select the team members you want to configure sharing for
3. Click **Share**
4. Set the **Robots** permission level
5. Click **Save**

For more on team management and sharing, see [Teams and roles](/account/teams-and-roles).

## Best practices

<AccordionGroup>
  <Accordion title="Start with default robots">
    The pre-built robots cover common use cases. Try them before building custom workflows.
  </Accordion>
  <Accordion title="Watch your scanned assets quota">
    Robots can generate many scans across many targets, especially domain-level robots that discover subdomains first. Each unique target counts against your [scanned assets limit](/plans-and-limits/assets-and-limits). Check your quota before running broad discovery robots.
  </Accordion>
  <Accordion title="Use scheduling for monitoring">
    Set up recurring robot runs to catch new vulnerabilities as they appear.
  </Accordion>
  <Accordion title="Test on non-production first">
    Verify robot behavior on test assets before running against production systems.
  </Accordion>
  <Accordion title="Share robots with your team">
    Share custom robots with team members so everyone follows the same testing methodology.
