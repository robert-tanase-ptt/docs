Pentest Robots are available on all paid plans. [View plans](/plans-and-limits/plan-overview)

## What are Pentest Robots?

Pentest Robots are pre-configured automation workflows that chain multiple security tools together. Each robot defines a sequence of scans and actions that execute automatically, saving you time and ensuring consistent testing across your assets.

Robots can be shared with team members, allowing your entire team to use the same automation workflows. See [Sharing robots](#sharing-robots) for details.

## Available robots

The platform includes pre-built robots for common security testing workflows:

| Robot Type | What It Does |
|------------|--------------|
| **Reconnaissance** | Discovers subdomains, fingerprints technologies, maps the attack surface |
| **Vulnerability Assessment** | Runs multiple scanners to identify security issues |
| **Full Pentest** | Combines discovery, scanning, and reporting in one flow |
| **Monitoring** | Periodic scans to detect changes and new vulnerabilities |

Some robots support cloning, allowing you to create your own customized copy.

## Running a Robot

<Steps>
  <Step title="Navigate to Robots">
    Go to **Automation → Robots** in the main navigation.
  </Step>
  <Step title="Select a Robot">
    Browse the available robots and click on one to view its details and workflow.
  </Step>
  <Step title="Start a New Scan">
    Click **New scan** and select the target(s) you want to scan.
  </Step>
  <Step title="Configure and Run">
    Review the configuration and start the robot. You'll be redirected to monitor progress.
  </Step>
</Steps>

## Scheduling robots

Robots support scheduled execution for ongoing security monitoring:

<Steps>
  <Step title="Start a New Scan">
    Click **New scan** on any robot.
  </Step>
  <Step title="Enable Scheduling">
    Toggle the scheduling option and configure:
    - **Frequency**: How often the robot should run (daily, weekly, monthly)
    - **Start date**: When to begin the schedule
  </Step>
  <Step title="Save Schedule">
    The robot will run automatically at the configured intervals.
  </Step>
</Steps>

<Info>
Scheduled robot scans appear in your [Scheduled Scans](/using/scans/scheduled-scans) list where you can manage, pause, or cancel them.
</Info>

## Managing robots

### Viewing robot details

Click on any robot to see:
- Description of what the robot does
- The workflow and tools it uses
- Execution history

### Cloning a Robot

Some robots support cloning, which creates a copy you can customize:

1. Open a robot that supports cloning
2. Click the options menu (⋮) and select **Clone**
3. Give your copy a new name and description
4. The cloned robot appears in your custom robots list

<Note>
Not all robots support cloning. If the options menu isn't available, the robot cannot be cloned.
</Note>

### Editing robots

For robots you own (cloned copies), you can update the name and description.

## Robot execution

When a robot runs:

1. **Sequential execution**: Tools run in the defined order
2. **Data flows between steps**: Output from one tool feeds into the next
3. **Conditions are evaluated**: Some robots include filters to control which findings trigger subsequent actions
4. **Results aggregate**: All findings from all tools appear in the final results

### Monitoring progress

During execution, you can:
- View real-time progress
- See which step is currently running
- Track findings as they're discovered

### Results

Robot scan results include:
- Combined findings from all tools in the workflow
- Individual tool outputs
- Execution timeline and duration

## Example use cases

| Goal | Robot Approach |
|------|----------------|
| **Onboard a new asset** | Run discovery robot to map subdomains, ports, technologies |
| **Regular vulnerability checks** | Schedule a vulnerability robot weekly |
| **Pre-release security check** | Run full assessment robot before deployments |
| **Continuous monitoring** | Schedule monitoring robot to alert on new issues |

## Sharing robots

Robots can be shared with team members (subusers) on your account. When you share robots, team members can run them against their targets.

### Permission levels

| Permission | What they can do |
|------------|------------------|
| **No access** | Cannot see or use your robots |
| **View** | Can view and run robots, but cannot edit or delete |
| **Edit** | Full access to view, run, edit, and delete robots |

### How to share robots

1. Go to **Settings** → **Team**
2. Select the team members you want to configure sharing for
3. Click **Share**
4. Set the **Robots** permission level
5. Click **Save**

Shared robots appear alongside default robots, allowing team members to run them on their targets.

<Tip>
Share your custom robots with team members to ensure everyone follows the same testing methodology.

## Best practices

<AccordionGroup>
  <Accordion title="Start with default robots">
    The pre-built robots cover common use cases. Try them before creating custom workflows.
  </Accordion>
  <Accordion title="Use scheduling for monitoring">
    Set up recurring robot runs to catch new vulnerabilities as they appear.
  </Accordion>
  <Accordion title="Clone when available">
    If a robot supports cloning, create a copy with a descriptive name that matches your workflow.
  </Accordion>
  <Accordion title="Test on non-production first">
    Verify robot behavior on test assets before running against production systems.
  </Accordion>
  <Accordion title="Share robots with your team">
    Create standardized automation workflows and share them with team members to ensure consistent testing across your organization.
