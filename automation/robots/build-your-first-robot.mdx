## Prerequisites

Before building a robot:
- Have at least one verified asset
- Understand basic scan concepts
- Know what you want to automate

## Creating a Robot

<Steps>
  <Step title="Navigate to Robots">
    Go to Automation → Robots in the navigation.
  </Step>
  <Step title="Create New Robot">
    Click "New Robot" and give it a name.
  </Step>
  <Step title="Add Trigger">
    Define what starts the robot.
  </Step>
  <Step title="Add Actions">
    Add the steps your robot should perform.
  </Step>
  <Step title="Configure Outputs">
    Set where results should go.
  </Step>
  <Step title="Save and Test">
    Save the robot and run a test.
  </Step>
</Steps>

## Example: Basic Security Scan Robot

Let's build a robot that:
1. Runs when manually triggered
2. Scans a website for vulnerabilities
3. Sends an email with results

### Step 1: Set Up Trigger

Select **Manual Trigger** for testing. You can change this to a schedule later.

### Step 2: Add Website Scan Action

1. Add action → Select "Website Vulnerability Scanner"
2. Configure target asset
3. Set scan depth (start with Light)

### Step 3: Add Notification

1. Add action → Select "Send Email"
2. Configure recipient
3. Set up email template with scan results

### Step 4: Test the Robot

1. Save the robot
2. Click "Run Now"
3. Monitor execution
4. Review results and email

## Robot Editor Interface

| Element | Purpose |
|---------|---------|
| Canvas | Visual workflow area |
| Toolbox | Available actions |
| Properties | Configure selected item |
| Execution Log | View run history |

## Tips for Success

<Tip>
Start with simple robots and add complexity gradually. It's easier to troubleshoot a simple robot.
</Tip>

<Warning>
Test robots with non-production assets first to ensure they work as expected.
</Warning>

## Common First Robots

| Robot | Description |
|-------|-------------|
| Scan and Report | Run scan, generate report, email results |
| Asset Discovery | Find subdomains, add to inventory |
| Continuous Monitoring | Weekly scans with alerting |
