## How Robots Work

Robots execute a sequence of steps:

```
Trigger → Action 1 → Action 2 → ... → Output
```

Each step can:
- Run a tool
- Process data
- Make decisions
- Send notifications

## Robot Components

### Triggers

What starts the robot:
- Manual execution
- Scheduled time
- Webhook
- New asset added

### Actions

What the robot does:
- Run scans
- Process results
- Filter findings
- Generate reports

### Outputs

Where results go:
- Dashboard
- Email
- Webhooks
- Integrations

## Example Use Cases

| Use Case | Robot Workflow |
|----------|----------------|
| New asset onboarding | Trigger on asset add → Run recon → Run vuln scan → Alert on findings |
| Weekly assessment | Schedule weekly → Scan all assets → Generate report → Email team |
| Finding response | New critical finding → Verify → Create ticket → Alert security |
