## Payment processor

Pentest-Tools.com uses [FastSpring](https://fastspring.com) as our payment processor. FastSpring is a PCI-compliant merchant of record that handles all payment processing, invoicing, and tax compliance.

## Accepted payment methods

### Credit and debit cards

All major credit and debit cards are accepted globally:

- Visa
- Mastercard
- American Express
- Discover
- JCB
- UnionPay

### Digital wallets

- PayPal (available globally except Turkey)
- Amazon Pay
- Apple Pay
- Google Pay

### Bank transfers

Bank transfers are available for custom deals, including annual and multi-year subscriptions. Since bank transfers are one-time payments, they require manual processing for each billing cycle.

Supported currencies: USD, EUR, GBP, INR, BRL, TRY, and JPY.

<Note>
Bank transfers are not available for standard self-service subscriptions. Contact sales for custom billing arrangements.
</Note>

## AWS Marketplace

Pentest-Tools.com is also available through [AWS Marketplace](https://aws.amazon.com/marketplace/pp/prodview-hbngy6inrni5s).

### Purchasing via AWS Marketplace

If you subscribe through AWS Marketplace:

- Billing is consolidated with your AWS account
- Payments are handled by AWS, not FastSpring
- You can use AWS credits or your existing AWS payment method

### Managing AWS subscriptions

<Warning>
Customers who purchased through AWS Marketplace **cannot** manage their subscription through the Pentest-Tools.com interface. All subscription changes must be made through AWS Marketplace.
</Warning>

In **My Account → Active plan**, AWS customers will see a **Manage contract** button that links directly to AWS Marketplace for subscription management.

## Changing your payment method

To update your payment method for an existing subscription:

<Steps>
  <Step title="Go to your active plan">
    Navigate to **My Account → Active plan**.
  </Step>
  <Step title="Click Change payment method">
    Click the **Change payment method** button.
  </Step>
  <Step title="Enter new payment details">
