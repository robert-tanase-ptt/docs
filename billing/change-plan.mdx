## Overview

You can change your subscription plan, asset limit, or add-ons at any time from **My Account → Active plan**.

<Info>
**AWS Marketplace customers**: If you purchased through AWS Marketplace, you must manage your subscription through AWS. See [Managing AWS subscriptions](/billing/payment-methods#aws-marketplace).
</Info>

<Info>
**Custom plan customers**: If you have a custom or enterprise plan, contact our support team to make changes to your subscription.
</Info>

## How changes are classified

Subscription changes are classified as **upgrades** or **downgrades** based on **price**, not features:

| Change type | When it applies | Billing | Effect |
|-------------|-----------------|---------|--------|
| **Upgrade** | New plan costs **more** than current plan | Prorated charge immediately | Instant activation |
| **Downgrade** | New plan costs **less** than current plan | No immediate charge | Takes effect at end of billing cycle |

<Note>
A change can be an "upgrade" even if you're moving to a plan with fewer features, what matters is whether you're paying more or less.

**Example**: Moving from Pentest Suite with 5 assets to NetSec with 100 assets is classified as an **upgrade** because the NetSec 100-asset plan costs more than your current Pentest Suite 5-asset plan.
</Note>

## Upgrades (paying more)

When your new subscription costs **more** than your current one:

- **Instant activation**: New features, assets, or add-ons are available immediately
- **Prorated billing**: You're charged the difference for the remainder of your current billing period
- **Next renewal**: Full new price applies at your next billing date

<Tip>
The platform calculates a prorated amount based on the days remaining in your billing cycle. You'll see this amount before confirming the upgrade.
</Tip>

## Downgrades (paying less)

When your new subscription costs **less** than your current one:

- **Scheduled change**: The downgrade takes effect at the end of your current billing cycle
- **No immediate refund**: You continue using your current plan until the billing period ends
- **Current features remain**: Full access to your current plan until the change takes effect

### Downgrade considerations

<Warning>
When the downgrade takes effect, you may lose access to features, assets, or capabilities. Review the impact before confirming.
</Warning>

| Impact | What happens |
|--------|--------------|
| Extra assets | Assets beyond your new limit become inaccessible |
| Scheduled scans | May be reduced to fit new limits |
| Team members | May lose access if Teams is not included |
| Advanced features | Exploitation tools, authenticated scanning, etc. may be disabled |

### Canceling a scheduled downgrade

If you have a scheduled downgrade pending, you can cancel it before it takes effect:

1. Go to **My Account → Active plan**
2. Click **Cancel scheduled changes**
3. Your subscription will continue at its current level

## Summary

| Action | When it takes effect | Billing |
|--------|---------------------|---------|
| Upgrade (pay more) | Immediately | Prorated charge now |
