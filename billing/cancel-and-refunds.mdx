## Canceling your subscription

Canceling your subscription is effectively a **downgrade to the Free plan**. The change takes effect at the end of your current billing period.

<Info>
**AWS Marketplace customers**: If you purchased through AWS Marketplace, you must cancel through AWS. See [Managing AWS subscriptions](/billing/payment-methods#aws-marketplace).
</Info>

<Info>
**Custom plan customers**: If you have a custom or enterprise plan, contact our support team to cancel.

## Your data after cancellation

### Data is retained

When you cancel, **your data is not automatically deleted**:

- You can still log in and view your data

However, on the Free plan:

- Some features become inaccessible

### Reactivating your subscription

You can resubscribe at any time:

1. Log into your account
2. Go to **My Account > Active plan**
3. Choose a plan and complete payment
4. Full access is restored immediately

## Refund policy

We offer a **limited refund policy** for first-time subscribers. If the platform doesn't meet your needs, you can request a refund under specific conditions.

Once a refund is processed, your account will be **closed automatically** and all associated data will be **permanently deleted**. Export any data you need before requesting a refund.
</Warning>
