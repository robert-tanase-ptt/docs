## Security certification

Pentest-Tools.com is ISO 27001 certified. The certification covers the information security management system for the platform and its underlying infrastructure.

## Data processing

### Data retention

We retain personal data for up to 24 months. Financial records are kept for 10 years as required by law. For full details, see our [privacy policy](https://pentest-tools.com/legal/privacy-policy).

### Data deletion

To request deletion of your personal data, contact [data.privacy@pentest-tools.com](mailto:data.privacy@pentest-tools.com). You can also export your scan data for up to 30 days after account termination.

## AI data policy

Our platform uses AI-powered features like the [Soft 404 detector](/ai/soft404detector) to improve scan accuracy. Here is how we handle your data for those features.

### Our AI infrastructure

Our AI features use different models depending on the task:

- **Proprietary models** for classification tasks like soft 404 detection, hosted on our own infrastructure (Linode for servers, Vast.ai for model hosting)
- **Azure-hosted models** for browser-based AI features like endpoint discovery and authentication, running within our controlled Azure infrastructure
- Infrastructure partners are contractually prohibited from accessing or using your data for any purpose beyond providing the service

### Data handling

- **No training on your data**: Your scan data is not used to train any AI models, whether proprietary or third-party
- **No data logging for AI debugging**: We do not log or retain your data for AI-related debugging purposes
- **No retention window**: We do not have a data retention window for AI processing
- **No external sharing**: Your data is not shared with any party outside of the infrastructure needed to run the feature

### Model training

Our foundational models were trained on a combination of public data and de-identified, aggregated historical user data. We are not currently training new models. If we develop future AI features that could use user data, we will be transparent and provide a clear opt-out.

### About AI accuracy

Our AI features do not hallucinate. That term describes generative AI systems, like chatbots, that can produce false information. Our models are predictive, not generative: they classify data rather than create content. A failure would be a misclassification, not an invention. We test our models for accuracy to keep that error rate low.

## Responsible disclosure

If you find a security vulnerability in our platform, email [security@pentest-tools.com](mailto:security@pentest-tools.com). Include a description of the issue and steps to reproduce it. We follow responsible disclosure practices and will keep you updated on the fix.

## Privacy and data requests

For GDPR requests, data deletion, or any other privacy concerns, contact [data.privacy@pentest-tools.com](mailto:data.privacy@pentest-tools.com).
