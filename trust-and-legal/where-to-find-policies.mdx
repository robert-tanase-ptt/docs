## AI Data Policy

Our platform uses AI-powered features like the [Soft 404 detector](/ai/soft404detector) to improve scan accuracy. Here's how we handle your data for AI features:

### Our AI infrastructure

- We use our own **proprietary AI models** to analyze your results
- Our platform runs on secure, industry-standard infrastructure partners (Linode for servers, Vast.ai for AI model hosting)
- Your data is processed only by our own models within this secure, isolated infrastructure
- Infrastructure partners are contractually prohibited from accessing or using your data for any other purpose

### What we don't do

- **No third-party AI models** — We do not use services like OpenAI, meaning your data is never sent to another company for their model training or analysis
- **No data logging for AI debugging** — We do not log or retain your data for AI-related debugging purposes
- **No retention window** — We do not have a data retention window for AI processing

### Model training

Our foundational models were trained using a combination of:
- Public data
- De-identified, aggregated historical user data

We are not currently training new models. If we develop future AI features that could use user data, we will be transparent and provide a clear opt-out control.

### About AI accuracy

Our AI features do not "hallucinate." This term describes Generative AI (like chatbots) that can invent false information. Our models are **predictive, not generative**:

- They don't create new content—they make decisions such as classifying data
- A failure in our models would be a misclassification or identification error, not a hallucination
- We rigorously test our models for accuracy to minimize these errors

## Responsible Disclosure

1. Email security@pentest-tools.com
