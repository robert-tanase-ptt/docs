- We recommend using a password manager and a unique password for this service

## Login history

Review your login history for suspicious activity at [**My Account > Security > Login history**](https://app.pentest-tools.com/account/security/login_history).

Each login event shows:

| Field | Description |
|-------|-------------|
| Date | When the login occurred |
| IP address | The IP address used |
| Location | Country and city (when available) |
| Client | Browser/device information |

<Tip>
Regularly review your login history for unauthorized access attempts. If you see suspicious activity, change your password immediately and enable 2FA.
</Tip>

## API key security

For API access, follow these best practices:

- Generate separate keys for different purposes
- Rotate keys periodically
- Revoke unused keys
- Never share keys in code or logs

See [API Authentication](/api-reference/authentication) for more details.
