## Workspace Access

### Workspace-Level Permissions

In addition to roles, access can be controlled per workspace:
- Users can be granted access to specific workspaces
- Workspace permissions override team-level for that workspace

### Access Scenarios

| Scenario | Setup |
|----------|-------|
| Full access | Admin role, all workspaces |
| Limited access | Member role, specific workspaces |
| Audit access | Viewer role, relevant workspaces |
