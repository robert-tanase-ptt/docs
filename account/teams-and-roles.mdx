## Overview

Teams allow you to invite colleagues to collaborate on security testing projects. Team members share your subscription resources while maintaining separate accounts, and you control exactly what each person can access.

<Info>
Teams is a plan feature available on paid subscriptions (NetSec, WebNetSec, and Pentest Suite).

## Team structure

| Role | Description |
|------|-------------|
| **Owner** | The account holder who manages the subscription, billing, and team membership |
| **Team Member** | Invited users who access shared workspaces and resources |

The owner invites team members and controls what each person can access through sharing settings.

  <Accordion title="Use workspaces to organize access">
    Create workspaces for different projects or clients, then share only the relevant workspaces with each team member.

  <Accordion title="Start with View permission">
    Grant View access initially, then upgrade to Edit when team members need to run scans or make changes.
  </Accordion>
  <Accordion title="Review sharing regularly">
    Periodically review who has access to what, especially when team members change roles or leave.
  </Accordion>
  <Accordion title="Remove access promptly">
    When someone leaves the team, remove their access immediately to maintain security.
  </Accordion>
