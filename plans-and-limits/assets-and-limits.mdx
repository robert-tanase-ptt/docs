## Assets overview

Assets are the targets you add to Pentest-Tools.com for security testing. Each unique target consumes one asset slot from your subscription.

For details on what counts as an asset, how assets are managed, and verification requirements, see the [Assets guide](/using/assets/assets).

## Added assets vs. scanned assets

Your subscription includes two distinct asset limits:

| Limit | Description |
|-------|-------------|
| **Max added assets** | Total number of unique assets you can add to your workspaces |
| **Max scanned assets** | Number of unique assets you can actively scan within a scan cycle |

<Info>
You can add more assets than your scanned assets limit allows. This lets you manage a larger inventory while focusing scans on priority targets each scan cycle.
</Info>

### How limits scale

Both limits are calculated based on your selected asset tier:

| Your asset tier | Max scanned assets | Max added assets |
|-----------------|-------------------|------------------|
| 5 | 5 | 100 |
| 25 | 25 | 500 |
| 100 | 100 | 2,000 |
| 500 | 500 | 10,000 |

<Tip>
**Formula**: Max added assets = 20 × your scanned assets tier. This gives you room to manage a larger asset inventory while focusing scans each cycle.
</Tip>

### Scan cycles

Your scanned assets counter resets at the start of each **scan cycle**, which is always monthly, even for annual subscriptions.

- You get a fresh allocation of scanning capacity each month
- Unused scanned asset slots don't roll over to the next cycle
- You can re-scan the same assets in a new scan cycle

### Tracking your usage

Monitor your asset usage in the web application:

- **[Scanned Assets](https://app.pentest-tools.com/account/plan_details/scanned_assets)**: View which assets have been scanned this scan cycle
- **[Scan History](https://app.pentest-tools.com/account/plan_details/scan_history)**: Review all scans that counted toward your limit

<Note>
Both pages show usage across **all workspaces** and **all team members** for the entire account. Both account owners and team members can access these pages to monitor team-wide usage. For more about team structure and permissions, see [Teams and roles](/account/teams-and-roles).
</Note>

## Scan limits

### Concurrent scans

The number of scans that can run simultaneously scales with your asset tier:

| Asset tier | Max parallel scans |
|------------|-------------------|
| Up to 49 | 2 |
| 50-299 | 5 |
| 300-500 | 10 |

<Info>
When you reach your concurrent scan limit, additional scans enter the **Waiting** state and run automatically as slots become available. See [Scans and statuses](/concepts/scans-and-statuses) for details on scan states.
</Info>

### Scan queue

The maximum number of scans that can wait in the queue:

| Asset tier | Max waiting scans |
|------------|------------------|
| 5 | 200 |
| 25 | 1,000 |
| 100 | 4,000 |
| 500 | 20,000 |

When you start a scan and all slots are occupied:

1. The scan enters the [Waiting state](/concepts/scans-and-statuses)
2. Queued scans start in order as running scans complete
3. If the queue is full, you must wait for a slot before starting more scans

### Scheduled scans

| Asset tier | Max active scheduled scans |
|------------|---------------------------|
| 5 | 100 |
| 25 | 500 |
| 100 | 2,000 |
| 500 | 10,000 |

<Note>
Scheduled scans count against your active schedule limit, not your concurrent scan limit. A scheduled scan only consumes a concurrent slot when it actually runs.
</Note>

**Scheduling frequencies:**
- **Free plans**: Weekly, Monthly
- **Paid plans**: Once, Daily, Weekly, Monthly, Quarterly, Yearly

See [Scheduled scans](/using/scans/scheduled-scans) for setup instructions.

## API limits

API access is available on all paid plans. See [API limits and errors](/api-reference/limits-and-errors) for rate limits and error handling.

## What happens when you hit limits

<AccordionGroup>
  <Accordion title="Max scanned assets reached">
    **Behavior**: Cannot scan additional unique targets this scan cycle.

    **Resolution**: Wait for your next scan cycle, or [upgrade your asset tier](/billing/change-plan).

    **Check usage**: Visit [Scanned Assets](https://app.pentest-tools.com/account/plan_details/scanned_assets) to see which assets count toward your limit.
  </Accordion>
  <Accordion title="Max added assets reached">
    **Behavior**: Cannot add new targets to your workspace.

    **Resolution**: Remove assets you no longer need, or upgrade your asset tier.
  </Accordion>
  <Accordion title="Concurrent scan limit reached">
    **Behavior**: New scans enter the [Waiting state](/concepts/scans-and-statuses) and are queued.

    **Resolution**: Wait for running scans to complete, or cancel lower-priority scans to free slots.
  </Accordion>
  <Accordion title="Scan queue full">
    **Behavior**: Cannot start additional scans until queue has space.

    **Resolution**: Wait for queued scans to start running, or cancel queued scans you no longer need.
  </Accordion>
  <Accordion title="Scheduled scan limit reached">
    **Behavior**: Cannot create new scheduled scans.

    **Resolution**: Delete or disable scheduled scans you no longer need. See [Scheduled scans](/using/scans/scheduled-scans).
  </Accordion>
  <Accordion title="API rate limit exceeded">
    **Behavior**: API returns HTTP 429 Too Many Requests.

    **Resolution**: Implement request throttling. See [API limits and errors](/api-reference/limits-and-errors).
  </Accordion>
</AccordionGroup>
