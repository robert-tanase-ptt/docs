## Overview

Pentest-Tools.com enforces resource limits to ensure fair usage and platform stability. These limits vary by plan and can be adjusted through upgrades or custom arrangements.

## Scan resource limits

### Concurrent scans

The number of scans that can run simultaneously:

| Resource | Free | Paid plans |
|----------|------|------------|
| Max parallel scans | 1 | 2 |
| Max waiting scans (queue) | 5 | 25 |

<Info>
When you reach your concurrent scan limit, additional scans are queued and run automatically as slots become available.
</Info>

### Scan queue behavior

When you start a scan and all slots are occupied:

1. The scan enters the waiting queue
2. Queued scans start in order as running scans complete
3. If the queue is full, you must wait for a slot before starting more scans

<Tip>
For large scanning operations, consider using pentest robots to orchestrate scans efficiently. Robots manage queuing automatically and can run complex workflows overnight.
</Tip>

### Scheduled scans

| Resource | Free | Paid plans |
|----------|------|------------|
| Max active scheduled scans | 0 | 25 |
| Scheduling frequencies | None | All (once, daily, weekly, monthly) |

<Note>
Scheduled scans count against your active schedule limit, not your concurrent scan limit. A scheduled scan only consumes a concurrent slot when it actually runs.
</Note>

## Asset limits

### Default limits

| Resource | Description |
|----------|-------------|
| Max added assets | 100 per account (base) |
| Max scanned assets | 5 per billing period (base) |

Asset limits scale with your selected asset tier at subscription time. Higher tiers provide proportionally more capacity.

### How limits apply

| Limit type | When it's checked |
|------------|-------------------|
| Max added assets | When you add a new target to your workspace |
| Max scanned assets | When you start a scan on a target during a billing period |

<Warning>
Hitting your max scanned assets limit means you cannot scan additional targets until your next billing period begins. Plan your scanning priorities accordingly.
</Warning>

## API rate limits

API access is available on all paid plans. Rate limits ensure fair usage across all users:

| Limit | Value |
|-------|-------|
| Requests per minute | 60 |
| Requests per hour | 1,000 |

### Rate limit headers

API responses include headers to help you track your usage:

```
X-RateLimit-Limit: 60
X-RateLimit-Remaining: 45
X-RateLimit-Reset: 1699876543
```

### Rate limit responses

When you exceed the rate limit, the API returns:

```json
{
  "error": "rate_limit_exceeded",
  "message": "Too many requests. Please retry after the reset time.",
  "retry_after": 45
}
```

<Tip>
Implement exponential backoff in your API integrations to handle rate limits gracefully. Wait the specified `retry_after` seconds before retrying.
</Tip>

See [API limits and errors](/api-reference/limits-and-errors) for complete API documentation.

## What happens when you hit limits

<AccordionGroup>
  <Accordion title="Concurrent scan limit reached">
    **Behavior**: New scans are automatically queued.

    **Resolution**: Wait for running scans to complete, or cancel lower-priority scans to free slots.
  </Accordion>
  <Accordion title="Scan queue full">
    **Behavior**: Cannot start additional scans until queue has space.

    **Resolution**: Wait for queued scans to start running, or cancel queued scans you no longer need.
  </Accordion>
  <Accordion title="Max added assets reached">
    **Behavior**: Cannot add new targets to your workspace.

    **Resolution**: Remove assets you no longer need, or upgrade your asset tier.
  </Accordion>
  <Accordion title="Max scanned assets reached">
    **Behavior**: Cannot scan additional unique targets this billing period.

    **Resolution**: Wait for your next billing period, or contact sales for a limit increase.
  </Accordion>
  <Accordion title="Scheduled scan limit reached">
    **Behavior**: Cannot create new scheduled scans.

    **Resolution**: Delete or disable scheduled scans you no longer need.
  </Accordion>
  <Accordion title="API rate limit exceeded">
    **Behavior**: API returns HTTP 429 Too Many Requests.

    **Resolution**: Wait for the rate limit window to reset, implement request throttling in your code.
  </Accordion>
</AccordionGroup>

## Checking your current usage

### In the web interface

Navigate to **Settings → Billing → Usage** to view:

- Current asset count vs. limit
- Scanned assets this period
- Active scheduled scans
- Days until billing period reset

### Via API

Use the account endpoint to retrieve usage programmatically:

```bash
curl -X GET 'https://api.pentest-tools.com/v2/account' \
  -H 'Authorization: Bearer YOUR_API_KEY'
```

Response includes your current limits and usage:

```json
{
  "plan": "webnetsec",
  "limits": {
    "max_added_assets": 100,
    "max_scanned_assets": 25,
    "max_parallel_scans": 2,
    "max_scheduled_scans": 25
  },
  "usage": {
    "added_assets": 45,
    "scanned_assets_this_period": 12,
    "active_scheduled_scans": 8,
    "billing_period_ends": "2024-02-15T00:00:00Z"
  }
}
```

## Requesting limit increases

<Tabs>
  <Tab title="Upgrade your plan">
    Moving to a higher-tier plan includes increased limits:

    1. Go to **Settings → Billing → Change plan**
    2. Select a higher plan or asset tier
    3. Review the new limits and complete the upgrade

    <Check>
    Upgrades take effect immediately with prorated billing.
    </Check>
  </Tab>
  <Tab title="Custom limits">
    For enterprise requirements beyond standard tiers:

    1. Contact our sales team at sales@pentest-tools.com
    2. Describe your use case and required limits
    3. We'll create a custom arrangement

    <Info>
    Custom limits are available for organizations with high-volume or specialized needs.
    </Info>
  </Tab>
  <Tab title="Temporary increases">
    For short-term projects requiring extra capacity:

    1. Contact support with your timeline and requirements
    2. We can arrange temporary limit increases for specific engagements
    3. Standard limits restore after the agreed period

    <Note>
    Temporary increases may incur additional charges depending on the scope.
    </Note>

## Optimizing within your limits

### Best practices for scan management

- **Prioritize targets** – Focus on high-value assets first each billing period
- **Use scan templates** – Save time by reusing configurations for similar targets
- **Schedule strategically** – Spread scheduled scans to avoid queue congestion
- **Monitor usage** – Check your usage dashboard weekly to avoid surprises

### Best practices for API usage

- **Batch operations** – Combine multiple operations into fewer API calls when possible
- **Cache responses** – Store responses locally to reduce redundant requests
- **Use webhooks** – Subscribe to webhooks instead of polling for status updates
- **Implement backoff** – Handle rate limits gracefully with exponential backoff
