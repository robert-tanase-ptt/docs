## What are assets?

Assets are the targets you add to Pentest-Tools.com for security testing. Each unique target consumes one asset slot from your subscription.

### What counts as an asset?

| Target type | Counts as | Example |
|-------------|-----------|---------|
| Domain | 1 asset | `example.com` |
| Subdomain | 1 asset | `app.example.com` |
| URL | 1 asset | `https://example.com/app` |
| IP address | 1 asset | `192.168.1.1` |
| IP range (CIDR) | 1 asset | `192.168.1.0/24` |

<Note>
Each unique target is counted separately. Scanning `example.com` and `api.example.com` consumes 2 asset slots.
</Note>

### Asset tiers

When subscribing or adjusting your plan, you can select from predefined asset tiers:

| Tier | Assets |
|------|--------|
| Starter | 5 |
| Small | 10, 15, 20, 25 |
| Medium | 50, 75, 100, 150 |
| Large | 200, 250, 300, 400, 500 |
| Enterprise | 1,000, 2,500, 5,000, 10,000 |

<Tip>
Volume discounts apply as you select higher asset tiers. Contact sales for custom asset quantities beyond 10,000.
</Tip>

## How assets work with scans

### Added assets vs. scanned assets

Your subscription includes two distinct limits:

| Limit | Description |
|-------|-------------|
| **Max added assets** | Total number of unique targets you can add to your workspace |
| **Max scanned assets** | Number of unique assets you can actively scan within a billing period |

<Info>
You can add more assets than your scanned assets limit allows. This lets you manage a larger inventory while focusing scans on priority targets each month.
</Info>

### Scanned assets reset

Your scanned assets counter resets at the start of each billing period. This means:

- You get a fresh allocation of scanning capacity each month
- Unused scanned asset slots don't roll over
- You can re-scan the same assets in a new billing period

## Managing your assets

### Adding assets

<Steps>
  <Step title="Navigate to Assets">
    Go to **Assets** in the main navigation.
  </Step>
  <Step title="Click Add Asset">
    Select **Add Asset** and choose the asset type.
  </Step>
  <Step title="Enter target details">
    Provide the target information (domain, IP, URL, or range).
  </Step>
  <Step title="Complete verification">
    For some targets, you'll need to verify ownership before scanning.
  </Step>
</Steps>

### Verifying asset ownership

Before scanning certain targets, Pentest-Tools.com requires ownership verification to ensure you have authorization. Verification methods include:

- **DNS TXT record** – Add a specific record to your domain's DNS
- **Meta tag** – Add a meta tag to your website's HTML
- **File upload** – Upload a verification file to your web server
- **Email verification** – Confirm ownership via email to the domain

<Warning>
Always ensure you have proper authorization before scanning any target. Unauthorized scanning may violate laws and terms of service.
</Warning>

### Removing assets

You can remove assets you no longer need to free up space:

<Steps>
  <Step title="Select the asset">
    Navigate to **Assets** and find the target you want to remove.
  </Step>
  <Step title="Open asset menu">
    Click the actions menu (three dots) on the asset row.
  </Step>
  <Step title="Delete asset">
    Select **Delete** and confirm the action.
  </Step>
</Steps>

<Warning>
Deleting an asset permanently removes all associated scan history, findings, and reports. This action cannot be undone.
</Warning>

## Scan presets and intensity

Scans come in different intensity levels, which affect thoroughness and resource consumption:

### Light scans

- **Faster execution** – Completes in minutes to hours depending on target size
- **Passive techniques** – Uses less intrusive detection methods
- **Common ports** – Scans top 10-100 most common ports
- **Lower resource usage** – Suitable for initial reconnaissance

### Deep scans

- **Thorough coverage** – Comprehensive vulnerability detection
- **Active techniques** – Uses more extensive detection methods
- **Extended ports** – Scans top 100-1000 ports
- **Higher resource usage** – Best for detailed security assessments

### Custom scans

Paid plans allow you to customize scan parameters beyond the Light and Deep presets:

- Select specific ports or port ranges
- Enable or disable specific detection modules
- Configure authentication for authenticated scanning
- Adjust scan timeouts and thresholds

<Tip>
Use Light scans for initial reconnaissance and regular monitoring. Reserve Deep scans for thorough assessments of priority targets.
</Tip>

## Monitoring your usage

### Dashboard indicators

Your dashboard displays:

- **Assets used** – Current count vs. your limit
- **Scanned assets this period** – How many unique assets you've scanned
- **Days until reset** – When your scanned assets counter resets

### Usage alerts

Configure notifications to alert you when:

- Approaching your asset limit
- Nearing your scanned assets limit
- A billing period is about to end

Go to **Settings → Notifications** to configure usage alerts.

## Optimizing your asset capacity

### Best practices

<AccordionGroup>
  <Accordion title="Organize by workspace">
    Use workspaces to organize assets by project, client, or environment. This makes it easier to manage scanning priorities and maintain focus.
  </Accordion>
  <Accordion title="Remove inactive assets">
    Periodically review and remove assets you no longer need to scan. This keeps your asset inventory lean and relevant.
  </Accordion>
  <Accordion title="Use IP ranges wisely">
    When scanning network ranges, use CIDR notation (e.g., `/24`) as a single asset rather than adding individual IPs. This conserves asset slots for large network assessments.
  </Accordion>
  <Accordion title="Plan your scanning cycle">
    Prioritize high-value targets early in your billing period. Schedule routine monitoring scans for regular coverage throughout the month.
  </Accordion>
</AccordionGroup>

## Increasing your capacity

If you regularly hit your asset limits, consider:

| Option | When to use |
|--------|-------------|
| **Upgrade asset tier** | You need more scanning capacity on your current plan |
| **Upgrade plan** | You need additional features alongside more capacity |
| **Contact sales** | You need custom quantities or enterprise arrangements |

<Note>
Upgrading mid-cycle prorates your charges. You'll only pay for the additional capacity from the upgrade date to your next billing date.
