## Managing add-ons

### Viewing active add-ons

Check your current add-ons in **Settings → Billing → Active plan**. You'll see:

- Which add-ons are active
- When each add-on renews
- Add-on costs on your subscription

### Canceling an add-on

To remove an add-on from your subscription:

1. Go to **Settings → Billing → Manage subscription**
2. Click **Remove** next to the add-on
3. Confirm the cancellation

<Warning>
Canceling the VPN add-on immediately disables all VPN profiles and terminates active agent connections. Download any configurations you need before canceling.

## When to use add-ons vs. upgrade

| Situation | Recommendation |
|-----------|----------------|
| Need internal network scanning only | VPN add-on |
| Need branded reports for clients | White Label add-on |
| Need more features + internal scanning | Consider upgrading plan + VPN add-on |
| Need everything | Higher plan + both add-ons |

<Tip>
Add-ons are billed as a percentage of your plan cost. If you're considering multiple add-ons alongside a plan upgrade, compare the total cost of different combinations to find the best value.
