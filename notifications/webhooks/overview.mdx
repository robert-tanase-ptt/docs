## What Are Webhooks?

Webhooks are HTTP callbacks that send data to your systems when events occur in Pentest-Tools.com.

## Use Cases

<CardGroup cols={2}>
  <Card title="Custom Integrations" icon="plug">
    Connect to any system with an HTTP API.
  </Card>
  <Card title="Automation" icon="robot">
    Trigger external workflows.
  </Card>
  <Card title="Logging" icon="file-lines">
    Send events to logging systems.
  </Card>
  <Card title="Alerting" icon="bell">
    Custom alerting pipelines.
  </Card>
</CardGroup>

## Setting Up Webhooks

<Steps>
  <Step title="Create Endpoint">
    Set up an HTTP endpoint to receive webhooks.
  </Step>
  <Step title="Configure Webhook">
    In Settings → Integrations → Webhooks, add your URL.
  </Step>
  <Step title="Select Events">
    Choose which events trigger the webhook.
  </Step>
  <Step title="Test">
    Send a test webhook to verify.
  </Step>
</Steps>

## Available Events

| Event | Trigger |
|-------|---------|
| `scan.started` | Scan begins |
| `scan.completed` | Scan finishes |
| `scan.failed` | Scan errors |
| `finding.new` | New finding discovered |
| `finding.updated` | Finding status changed |

## Webhook Payload

```json
{
  "event": "finding.new",
  "timestamp": "2024-01-15T10:30:00Z",
  "data": {
    "finding_id": 123,
    "title": "SQL Injection",
    "severity": "high",
    "asset": "example.com",
    "scan_id": 456
  }
}
```

## Security

### Verification

Webhooks include a signature header for verification:

```
X-Webhook-Signature: sha256=abc123...
```

Verify using your webhook secret:

```python
import hmac
import hashlib

def verify_webhook(payload, signature, secret):
    expected = hmac.new(
        secret.encode(),
        payload.encode(),
        hashlib.sha256
    ).hexdigest()
    return hmac.compare_digest(f"sha256={expected}", signature)
```

### Best Practices

<Warning>
Always verify webhook signatures to ensure requests are legitimate.
</Warning>

- Use HTTPS endpoints
- Verify signatures
- Implement idempotency
- Handle retries

## Retry Behavior

Failed webhooks are retried:
- 3 retry attempts
- Exponential backoff
- After 3 failures, webhook is disabled
