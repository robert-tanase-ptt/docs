  "tool": "Website Scanner",
  "status": "finished",
  "findings_count": 3,

  "high": 1,
  "medium": 2,
  "low": 0,
  "info": 0,
  "scan_url": "https://app.pentest-tools.com/scans/12345"
}
```

### Full scan JSON

The full JSON format includes:

- Scan metadata (target, tool, status, timing)
- All findings with full details
- Evidence and remediation recommendations
- CVSS scores and CVE references

## Creating a Webhook

1. Go to **Settings** → **Integrations** → **Webhooks**
2. Click **Add webhook**
3. Enter a **name** for identification
4. Enter the **URL** of your endpoint
5. Select the **payload format**
6. Save the webhook

## Using webhooks in notifications

Once created, webhooks appear as destination options when creating notifications:

1. Go to **Notifications**
2. Create or edit a notification
3. Enable **Webhook** as a destination
4. Select your webhook from the dropdown

## Endpoint Requirements

Your endpoint should:

- Accept HTTP POST requests
- Return a 2xx status code on success
- Handle the JSON or multipart/form-data (for PDF) content type
- Respond within 30 seconds

## Headers

Webhook requests include these headers:

| Header | Description |
|--------|-------------|
| `Content-Type` | `application/json` or `multipart/form-data` |
| `User-Agent` | Pentest-Tools.com user agent |
| `PTT-SCAN-ID` | The scan ID(s) that triggered the webhook |

## Error handling

If your endpoint fails to respond:

- The request is retried up to 3 times
- Retries use exponential backoff
- Failed webhooks are logged for review

<Warning>
If webhooks consistently fail, they may be disabled. Check your endpoint is accessible and returning successful responses.
</Warning>
