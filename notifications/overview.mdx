## What are notifications?

Notifications allow you to receive alerts when scan results match specific conditions. Instead of manually checking every scan, you can set up rules to be notified only when something important happens.

## How notifications work

<Steps>
  <Step title="Create a notification rule">
    Define what conditions should trigger an alert.
  </Step>
  <Step title="Choose a trigger type">
    Select what type of scan results to monitor (vulnerability, ports, scan status, etc.).
  </Step>
  <Step title="Set conditions">
    Specify the exact criteria (e.g., risk level is at least High).
  </Step>
  <Step title="Select destinations">
    Choose where to send the notification (email, Slack, webhook, etc.).
  </Step>
</Steps>

## Trigger types

Notifications can be triggered based on different types of scan results:

| Trigger | Description |
|---------|-------------|
| **Vulnerability** | Findings from vulnerability scans |
| **Scan status** | Scan completion status (finished, failed, timed out, etc.) |
| **Port Scanner** | Open ports discovered by the Port Scanner or Network Scanner |
| **Technology found** | Technologies detected by Website Recon or SNMP Scanner |
| **Subdomains** | Subdomains discovered by the Subdomain Finder |
| **URL Fuzzer** | Items found by the URL Fuzzer |
| **Password Auditor** | Credentials found by the Password Auditor |
| **Domains** | Domains found by the Domain Finder |

## Condition examples

### Vulnerability conditions

| Condition | Operators | Example |
|-----------|-----------|---------|
| **Risk level** | is at least | Alert when risk is at least High |

## Creating a Notification

1. Go to **Notifications** in the sidebar
2. Click **Add**
3. Enter a **name** for the notification
4. Select a **trigger type** (e.g., Vulnerability)
5. Add **conditions** (e.g., Risk level is at least High)
6. Select **destinations** under "Notification actions":
   - Send to default email
   - Send to additional emails (enter custom email addresses)
   - Send to Webhook, Microsoft Teams, Slack, Discord, or Nucleus
7. Click **Save**

<Tip>
You can add multiple conditions to a single notification. All conditions must match (AND logic) for the notification to trigger.
</Tip>

## Workspace scope

Notifications are scoped to your current workspace. Each workspace can have its own set of notification rules.

The notifications configured on this page are applied to **all scans** running in the current workspace, whether started manually, scheduled, or via API. A notification will be sent if a scan result matches **any** of the defined notification rules in the workspace.

## Enabling and Disabling

You can enable or disable notifications without deleting them:

- **Enabled**: Notification will trigger when conditions match
- **Disabled**: Notification is saved but won't trigger

## Diff notifications

A powerful feature is the ability to get notified when scan results **change** from previous scans:

- **New vulnerabilities**: Get alerted when new findings appear
- **New ports**: Get alerted when new ports are discovered
- **New subdomains**: Get alerted when new subdomains are found

This is useful for scheduled scans where you want to track changes over time.

## Best practices

<AccordionGroup>
  <Accordion title="Start with high-severity alerts">
    Begin by setting up notifications for critical and high severity findings. Add more granular rules as needed.
  </Accordion>
  <Accordion title="Use meaningful names">
    Name notifications descriptively (e.g., "Critical vulns - Production") so you can easily manage them.
  </Accordion>
  <Accordion title="Combine conditions wisely">
    Use multiple conditions to reduce noise. For example, "Risk level at least High" AND "Finding name contains SQL".
  </Accordion>
  <Accordion title="Leverage diff notifications">
    For scheduled scans, use diff notifications to only alert on changes instead of every finding.
  </Accordion>
</AccordionGroup>

<Warning>
Too many notifications can lead to alert fatigue. Focus on actionable alerts rather than notifying on everything.
</Warning>
