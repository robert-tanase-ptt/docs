<Steps>
  <Step title="Access integration settings">
    Go to Settings → Integrations → Jira.

  <Step title="Enter Jira URL">
    Add your Jira instance URL (e.g., `https://yourcompany.atlassian.net`).

  <Step title="Add credentials">
    Enter your Jira email and API token.

  <Step title="Specify project">

## Getting your API token

For Jira Cloud:

1. Go to [Atlassian Account Settings](https://id.atlassian.com/manage/api-tokens)
2. Click **Create API token**
3. Name the token (e.g., "Pentest-Tools.com")
4. Copy the token and save it securely

<Warning>

</Warning>

## Creating Jira tickets

Once configured, you can send findings to Jira:

1. Navigate to a finding in Pentest-Tools.com
2. Click **Send to Jira**
3. The ticket is created in your specified project

### Ticket contents

Created Jira tickets include:

| Field | Content |
|-------|---------|
| **Summary** | Finding name and target |
| **Description** | Full finding details, evidence, and remediation |
| **Issue type** | Task |
| **Labels** | `pentest-tools.com` |

### Bulk ticket creation

You can also send multiple findings to Jira at once:

1. Select multiple findings from the findings list
2. Click **Send to Jira**
3. One ticket is created for each selected finding

## Tracking tickets

Once a finding is sent to Jira:

- The finding shows a link to the Jira ticket
- You can track which findings have associated tickets
- Click the link to jump directly to Jira

## Best practices

<Tip>
Use Jira labels and components to organize security tickets separately from regular development work.
</Tip>

### Prioritizing tickets

- Send critical and high findings immediately
- Batch medium and low findings for regular triage
- Use finding severity to set Jira priority

### Team workflow

- Assign tickets to appropriate team members in Jira
- Use Jira automation for routing and notifications
- Link related tickets for comprehensive remediation

## Configuration reference

| Setting | Description |
|---------|-------------|
| **Jira URL** | Your Jira instance URL |
| **Email** | Your Jira account email |
| **API Key** | Your Jira API token |
| **Project Key** | The project key for ticket creation (e.g., SEC, VULN) |
