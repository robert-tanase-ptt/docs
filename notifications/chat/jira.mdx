## Best Practices

<Tip>
Use Jira labels or components to organize security tickets separately from regular development work.
</Tip>

### Avoiding Ticket Spam

<Warning>
Creating tickets for every finding can overwhelm teams. Consider limiting auto-creation to high-severity findings.
</Warning>

- Auto-create: Critical and High only
- Manual: Medium and below
- Use Jira automation for routing
