### Channel examples

| Channel | Purpose |
|---------|---------|
| #security-critical | Critical findings only |

## Best practices

<Tip>
Create a dedicated channel for critical findings and enable notifications/alerts on that channel for immediate attention.

Avoid sending all notifications to general channels. This creates noise and leads to ignored alerts.
