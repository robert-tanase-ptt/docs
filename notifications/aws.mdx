## Overview

The AWS integration allows you to import targets directly from your AWS infrastructure, making it easy to scan your EC2 instances and S3 buckets.

<Info>
Available on **NetSec**, **WebNetSec**, and **Pentest Suite** plans.

## Setting up AWS integration

<Steps>
  <Step title="Create IAM credentials">
    In AWS, create an IAM user with read-only permissions.
  </Step>
  <Step title="Configure integration">
    In Pentest-Tools.com, go to Settings → Integrations → AWS.
  </Step>
  <Step title="Enter credentials">
    Add your AWS Access Key ID and Secret Access Key.
  </Step>
  <Step title="Import targets">
    Select services and regions, then import.
  </Step>
</Steps>

## IAM Configuration

Create an IAM user with minimal read-only permissions:

### EC2 Permissions

```json
{
  "Version": "2012-10-17",
  "Statement": [
    {
      "Effect": "Allow",
      "Action": "ec2:DescribeInstances",
      "Resource": "*"
    }
  ]
}
```

### S3 Permissions

```json
{
  "Version": "2012-10-17",
  "Statement": [
    {
      "Effect": "Allow",
      "Action": "s3:ListAllMyBuckets",
      "Resource": "*"
    }
  ]
}
```

<Warning>
Use the principle of least privilege. Only grant the permissions needed for the services you want to import.
</Warning>

## Supported services

| Service | What's Imported |
|---------|-----------------|
| **EC2** | Running instance IP addresses (public or private) |
| **S3** | S3 bucket URLs |

## Import options

### EC2 Options

| Option | Description |
|--------|-------------|
| **Public IP** | Import the public IP address of instances |
| **Private IP** | Import the private IP address (requires VPN) |

<Tip>
Use private IP import with VPN if you need to scan instances that aren't publicly accessible.
</Tip>

### Region selection

Select which AWS regions to import from. Running instances and buckets are discovered in the selected regions.

## Imported targets

When targets are imported:

- EC2 instances appear as targets with the instance name and ID
- S3 buckets appear as HTTPS URLs
- Targets are added to your current workspace
- You can scan them immediately after import

### Example imported targets

| Source | Target Name |
|--------|-------------|
| EC2 | `10.0.1.50` (AWS EC2 - WebServer i-1234567890abcdef0) |
| S3 | `https://my-bucket.s3.amazonaws.com` |

## Best practices

- Create a dedicated IAM user for Pentest-Tools.com
- Use read-only permissions only
- Rotate access keys periodically
- Import targets before major security assessments
- Use workspaces to organize imported targets by environment

## Troubleshooting
