### Finding Format

Findings are formatted according to AWS Security Finding Format (ASFF):

```json
{
  "SchemaVersion": "2018-10-08",
  "Id": "finding-123",
  "ProductArn": "arn:aws:securityhub:...",
  "GeneratorId": "pentest-tools",

  "Severity": {
    "Label": "HIGH"
  },
  "Title": "SQL Injection Vulnerability",
  "Description": "..."
}
```

## Lambda Triggers

Trigger Lambda functions for custom processing.

### Example Use Cases
