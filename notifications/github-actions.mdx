## Setting up GitHub Actions

<Steps>
  <Step title="Create an action">
    Go to Settings → Integrations → GitHub Actions → Create action.
  </Step>
  <Step title="Configure the action">
    Set the target, scan type, output format, and fail condition.
  </Step>
  <Step title="Copy the secret">
    Save the generated secret for use in your GitHub workflow.
  </Step>
  <Step title="Add to your workflow">
    Add the action to your GitHub workflow YAML file.
  </Step>
</Steps>

## Action configuration

| Setting | Description |
|---------|-------------|
| **Name** | A descriptive name for the action |
| **Target** | The URL or IP to scan |
| **Scan type** | Light or Deep scan preset |
| **Output format** | `text` or `json` for results |
| **Fail condition** | Severity threshold to fail the build |

### Fail conditions

Configure when your pipeline should fail:

| Condition | Build fails when... |
|-----------|---------------------|
| None | Never fails based on findings |
| Low | Low or higher severity found |
| Medium | Medium or higher severity found |
| High | High or higher severity found |
| Critical | Critical severity found |

## Example workflow

```yaml
name: Security Scan

on:
  push:
    branches: [main]
  pull_request:
    branches: [main]

jobs:
  security-scan:
    runs-on: ubuntu-latest
    steps:
      - name: Run Pentest-Tools.com scan
        env:
          PTT_SECRET: ${{ secrets.PTT_ACTION_SECRET }}
        run: |
          curl -X POST https://app.pentest-tools.com/api/v2/ci-cd/run \
            -H "Authorization: Bearer $PTT_SECRET" \
            -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
            -d '{"action_name": "my-security-scan"}'
```

## Scan types

| Type | Description | Use Case |
|------|-------------|----------|
| **Light** | Fast reconnaissance scan | Quick checks, PR validation |
| **Deep** | Comprehensive vulnerability scan | Pre-production, scheduled scans |

<Tip>
Use Light scans for PR validation to keep CI times short, and schedule Deep scans for nightly or weekly runs.
</Tip>

## Output formats

### Text output

Human-readable summary of findings, ideal for quick review in logs.

### JSON Output

Structured data for programmatic processing:

```json
{
  "scan_id": 12345,
  "target": "example.com",
  "findings": [
    {
      "title": "SQL Injection",
      "severity": "high",
      "description": "..."
    }
  ]
}
```

## Best practices

<Warning>
Store your action secret in GitHub Secrets, never commit it to your repository.
</Warning>

- Use fail conditions appropriate to your pipeline stage
- Run Light scans on PRs, Deep scans on main branch
- Review findings before merging, even if build passes
- Set up notifications for failed security checks

## Troubleshooting

<AccordionGroup>
  <Accordion title="Scan not running">
    - Verify the action secret is correct
    - Check that the action exists and is enabled
    - Review GitHub Actions logs for errors
  </Accordion>
  <Accordion title="Build failing unexpectedly">
    - Review the fail condition setting
    - Check if findings meet the threshold
    - Verify the target is accessible
  </Accordion>
</AccordionGroup>
