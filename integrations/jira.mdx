## Overview

The Jira integration allows you to create Jira tickets directly from your security findings, which simplifies handing off issues to development teams for remediation.

<Info>
Available on **NetSec**, **WebNetSec**, and **Pentest Suite** plans.
</Info>

## Setting up Jira

<Steps>
  <Step title="Access integration settings">
    Go to Settings > Integrations > Jira.
  </Step>
  <Step title="Enter Jira URL">
    Add your Jira instance URL (e.g., `https://yourcompany.atlassian.net`).
  </Step>
  <Step title="Add credentials">
    Enter your Jira email and API token.
  </Step>
  <Step title="Specify project">
    Enter the project key where tickets will be created.
  </Step>
</Steps>

## Getting your API token

For Jira Cloud:

1. Go to [Atlassian Account Settings](https://id.atlassian.com/manage/api-tokens)
2. Click **Create API token**
3. Name the token (e.g., "Pentest-Tools.com")
4. Copy the token and save it securely

<Warning>
API tokens cannot be viewed again after creation. Store your token securely.
</Warning>

## Creating Jira tickets

Once configured, you can send findings to Jira from the [findings list](/using/findings/findings) in two ways:

**Single finding:** open a finding and click **Send to Jira**, or use the row action menu.

**Multiple findings at once:** select findings from the list, then click **Send to Jira** in the toolbar. One ticket is created per finding.

When sending in bulk, you can filter which findings to include:

- Include or exclude false positives
- Include or exclude informational findings
- Include or exclude unverified findings
- Include or exclude duplicates

### Ticket contents

Each Jira ticket includes:

| Field | Content |
|-------|---------|
| **Summary** | Finding name and target |
| **Description** | Full finding details, evidence, and remediation steps |
| **Issue type** | Task |
| **Labels** | `pentest-tools.com` |

## Tracking tickets

Once a finding is sent to Jira:

- The finding shows a link to the Jira ticket
- You can track which findings have associated tickets
- Click the link to jump directly to Jira

## Best practices

<Tip>
Use Jira labels and components to organize security tickets separately from regular development work.
</Tip>

### Prioritizing tickets

- Send critical and high findings immediately
- Batch medium and low findings for regular triage
- Use finding severity to set Jira priority

### Team workflow

- Assign tickets to appropriate team members in Jira
- Use Jira automation for routing and notifications
- Link related tickets for comprehensive remediation

## Configuration reference

| Setting | Description |
|---------|-------------|
| **Jira URL** | Your Jira instance URL |
| **Email** | Your Jira account email |
| **API Key** | Your Jira API token |
| **Project Key** | The project key for ticket creation (e.g., SEC, VULN) |
