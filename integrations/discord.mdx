## Channel strategies

<CardGroup cols={2}>
  <Card title="Dedicated channel" icon="hashtag">
    Create a dedicated #security-alerts channel for all notifications.
  </Card>
  <Card title="Multiple channels" icon="folder">
    Route by severity or project for better organization.
  </Card>
</CardGroup>

### Recommended setup

| Channel | Notifications |
|---------|---------------|
| #security-critical | Critical and high findings only |
| #security-activity | All scan completions |
| #project-specific | Project-related alerts |

## Best practices

<Tip>
Create a dedicated channel for security notifications to avoid noise in general channels.
</Tip>

<Warning>
Keep your webhook URL confidential. Anyone with the URL can send messages to your channel.
</Warning>

- Use channel permissions to control who can see notifications
- Consider muting the channel and checking periodically for non-critical alerts
- Enable notifications for critical findings only

## Troubleshooting
