## Overview

The Nucleus integration enables you to send security findings to Nucleus for centralized vulnerability management and tracking.

<Info>
Available on **NetSec**, **WebNetSec**, and **Pentest Suite** plans.
</Info>

## What is Nucleus?

Nucleus is a vulnerability management platform that aggregates findings from multiple security tools into a single view. It handles deduplication across tools, remediation workflows, and reporting.

## Setting up Nucleus

<Steps>
  <Step title="Get API credentials">
    In Nucleus, obtain your API key.
  </Step>
  <Step title="Configure credentials">
    In Pentest-Tools.com, go to Settings > Integrations > Nucleus and enter your subdomain and API key.
  </Step>
  <Step title="Add projects">
    Add Nucleus projects to send findings to.
  </Step>
  <Step title="Start sending">
    Send findings manually or configure automatic sync.
  </Step>
</Steps>

## Sending findings

You can send findings to Nucleus from the [findings list](/using/findings/findings) in two ways:

**Single finding:** open a finding and click **Send to Nucleus**, or use the row action menu.

**Multiple findings at once:** select findings from the list, then click **Send to Nucleus** in the toolbar. Choose the target Nucleus project and the findings are queued for upload. You get a notification when the upload completes.

### Automatic sync via notifications

You can also configure [notifications](/notifications/overview) to send scan results to Nucleus automatically when scans complete:

1. Create a notification
2. Select a Nucleus project as the destination
3. Findings are sent when scans finish

## Nucleus projects

Add multiple Nucleus projects to organize findings:

| Field | Description |
|-------|-------------|
| **Project name** | Display name in Pentest-Tools.com |
| **Project ID** | The Nucleus project identifier |

<Tip>
Create different projects for different environments (production, staging) or teams.
</Tip>

## What gets sent

| Data | Description |
|------|-------------|
| **Findings** | Vulnerability details and evidence |
| **Asset info** | Target IP, hostname, URL |
| **Severity** | Mapped to Nucleus levels |
| **Scan info** | Tool and scan details |

### Severity mapping

| Pentest-Tools.com | Nucleus |
|-------------------|---------|
| Critical | Critical |
| High | High |
| Medium | Medium |
| Low | Low |
| Info | Informational |

## Tracking sent findings

After sending findings to Nucleus:

- Findings show a Nucleus indicator
- You can track which findings have been sent
- Avoid duplicate submissions

## Troubleshooting
