    All notifications to one channel.

    **Pros**: Simple, everyone sees everything

  </Tab>
  <Tab title="Multiple Channels">
    Route by severity or project.

    **Pros**: Organized, relevant alerts

    **Cons**: More setup required
  </Tab>
</Tabs>

### Channel examples

| Channel | Purpose |
|---------|---------|
| #security-critical | Critical findings only |
| #security-scans | All scan activity |
| #project-client-a | Client-specific alerts |

## Best practices

<Tip>
Create a dedicated channel for critical findings and enable notifications/alerts on that channel for immediate attention.
</Tip>

<Tip>
Avoid sending all notifications to general channels. This creates noise and leads to ignored alerts.
