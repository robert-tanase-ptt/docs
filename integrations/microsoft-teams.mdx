## Message cards

Teams notifications use Adaptive Cards:

- Severity color coding
- Action buttons
- Direct links to findings

## Channel strategy

  <Card title="Security Team Channel" icon="shield">
    All security-related notifications.
  </Card>
  <Card title="Project Channels" icon="folder">
    Project-specific alerts.
  </Card>
</CardGroup>

### Recommended setup

| Channel | Notifications |
|---------|---------------|
| Security-Alerts | Critical and High findings |
| Security-Activity | All scan completions |
| Project channels | Project-specific findings |

## Best practices

<Tip>
Use @mentions in Teams to alert specific people when critical findings are detected.
</Tip>

### Enterprise considerations

- Coordinate with IT for webhook permissions
- Follow your organization's data policies
- Consider compliance requirements

<Warning>
Webhook URLs can be used by anyone who has them. Keep URLs confidential and rotate if compromised.
